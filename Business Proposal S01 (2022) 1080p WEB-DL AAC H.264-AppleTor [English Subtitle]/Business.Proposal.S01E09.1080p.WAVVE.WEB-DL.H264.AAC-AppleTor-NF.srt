00:00:00,064 --> 00:00:04,926
BUSINESS PROPOSAL

2
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:06,846
EPISODE 9

3
00:00:14,726 --> 00:00:16,811
You won't say
this is a mistake too, right?

4
00:00:19,272 --> 00:00:20,941
I'll pay you back for that kiss

5
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:23,026
with another kiss.

6
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:48,843
What's going on here?

7
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:49,844
First of all,

8
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:51,763
I'm very sorry.

9
00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:53,682
-What?
-As you probably know,

10
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:55,308
I'm not President Kang.

11
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:57,477
I'm Cha Sung-hoon, his secretary.

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,229
-What?
-President Kang

13
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:01,690
has someone else
that he wishes to marry.

14
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:04,609
I'm here instead, since this meeting
couldn't go on as planned.

15
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:08,029
I'm very sorry.

16
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:24,379
Hello?

17
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:26,631
Hey, you're up. Did you sleep well?

18
00:01:26,715 --> 00:01:28,341
Yes. How about you?

19
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:29,467
I didn't sleep well.

20
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:30,844
Why?

21
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:32,512
Because I missed you so much.

22
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:34,681
Come on, what are you saying?

23
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:37,434
I'm in front of your house.
Let's go on a date before work.

24
00:01:37,517 --> 00:01:38,351
What?

25
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:41,312
But it'll take a while
for me to get ready.

26
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:43,773
It's okay. I'll wait. Take your time.

27
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:45,650
Although…

28
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:49,571
I want to see you as soon as possible.

29
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:52,574
What?

30
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:57,120
Does he want me to take my time
or hurry up? What should I do?

31
00:03:00,058 --> 00:03:02,060
Are you okay?
Should I go get some medicine?

32
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:04,729
No, it's fine.

33
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:06,689
I'll be fine after eating some soup.

34
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,276
-It's hot!
-Here.

35
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,905
Just how much did you drink yesterday?

36
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:18,701
My team members are heavy drinkers.

37
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:23,289
By the way, this soup is so good.

38
00:03:23,373 --> 00:03:24,415
You're a good cook.

39
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:27,377
These are all my company's products,
and I'm a terrible cook.

40
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,837
Mr. Kang is a good cook.

41
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:33,591
Right. I heard that Kang Tae-moo
went on a blind date with Yu-jeong.

42
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:35,635
How could he do that when he has Ha-ri?

43
00:03:35,718 --> 00:03:36,928
What's wrong with him?

44
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:38,471
Young-seo, actually--

45
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:42,559
I have a morning meeting!
I'm so forgetful.

46
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:44,310
I have to run, Sung-hoon.

47
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:46,020
Thank you so much for the food.

48
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:49,941
I hope your business trip goes well.
I'll text you.

49
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:51,860
Text me!

50
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,415
This place is really popular nowadays.

51
00:04:05,498 --> 00:04:07,625
I didn't know they were open at this hour.

52
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,711
My friend owns this place.
He did me a favor.

53
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:10,795
Please, sit.

54
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:13,006
Thank you.

55
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,013
I'm going on a business trip to the States

56
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:21,973
so I wanted to have breakfast together.

57
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:25,602
Wait here.

58
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:29,230
You're going to cook yourself?

59
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:32,984
Yes. The most popular
brunch course here was my idea.

60
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:35,445
I'll make you the original version,
so just you wait.

61
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,241
I'm already worried

62
00:05:22,325 --> 00:05:25,078
that you'll love it and ask me
to make it for you every day.

63
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:30,833
Thank you for the meal.

64
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:35,838
Why aren't you eating?

65
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:40,885
This is so pretty. Can I take a picture?

66
00:05:44,722 --> 00:05:47,058
What about me?
I'm the one who did all the work.

67
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:56,150
Sorry.

68
00:05:57,318 --> 00:05:58,277
Why, this…

69
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:00,238
Your shoes…

70
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,823
What about my shoes?

71
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,127
You missed me so much that you didn't
know you put on mismatched shoes?

72
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,044
Wait…

73
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:17,046
Why did I…

74
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:20,216
Wait, your earrings are…

75
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:21,926
They're two different earrings?

76
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:24,303
No, they're pretty.

77
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:26,848
Darn it.

78
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:28,516
Are you having fun teasing me?

79
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:29,767
Yes.

80
00:06:30,852 --> 00:06:31,978
Fine.

81
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:36,190
I was so nervous
that I put on two different shoes.

82
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:38,693
And I don't even know
if I can digest this food.

83
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:41,487
I don't usually get this nervous.
Why am I being so nervous?

84
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:43,531
I look so stupid, don't I?

85
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:46,117
You keep cheating.

86
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,618
What do you mean, cheating?

87
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:50,580
My heart just skipped a beat
because you're so cute.

88
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:59,547
What are you doing?

89
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:03,843
My face is getting a bit red
right now, right?

90
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:06,012
Can you not look at me? I'm embarrassed.

91
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:19,692
We'll be right on time if we leave now.

92
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:21,778
No, let's go separately from here.

93
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:24,405
Why? Let me drive you somewhere near work.

94
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:27,784
What if someone sees me
getting out of your car?

95
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:29,994
But it's a pretty long way.

96
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:32,330
It's okay, I'll take the bus.

97
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:33,539
Drive safely.

98
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:46,094
You know, this was
the most wonderful morning of my life.

99
00:07:56,938 --> 00:07:59,023
-Ms. Kim. Good morning.
-Hello.

100
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:00,942
Good morning.

101
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:01,984
Hello.

102
00:08:04,028 --> 00:08:05,738
How come you're coming in together?

103
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:08,074
We met in front of the building.

104
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:10,410
Yes, in front. In the morning.

105
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:13,454
You know, I smelled grapefruit
when you three came in.

106
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:14,914
It's not me.

107
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,126
It's coming from Ms. Yeo.

108
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:20,670
Mr. Gye smells like it too.

109
00:08:20,753 --> 00:08:22,463
You two must use the same shampoo.

110
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:27,969
Come on. I don't like that.
Why do you use the same shampoo as me?

111
00:08:28,052 --> 00:08:30,555
That's what I should say.

112
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:33,307
I should wash my hair again. Really.

113
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:34,767
What's wrong with that?

114
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:36,436
You guys are overreacting.

115
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,812
Right?

116
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:41,149
Right! Congratulations, Ms. Shin.

117
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:43,151
-On what?
-What do you think?

118
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:45,736
Because of that video, Ms. Shin…

119
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,071
The video's a huge hit.

120
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:49,365
-A huge hit?
-Yes.

121
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:53,035
Because Ms. Shin mentioned
that we don't use any artificial coloring,

122
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,996
our sales have increased by 20 percent.

123
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:55,913
Really?

124
00:08:58,332 --> 00:08:59,417
Did you

125
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:02,670
have a good time with Ms. Shin yesterday?

126
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:09,343
I'm not telling you.
You didn't tell me who you were dating.

127
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:13,556
I'll get going, then.

128
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:17,018
Oh, right. Get me some women's heels.

129
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:18,644
The size

130
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:20,730
should be 230.

131
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:23,274
What? Why do you need women's heels
all of a sudden?

132
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:24,192
Who are they for?

133
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:27,945
My girlfriend.

134
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,405
Girlfriend?

135
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:31,115
No way.

136
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:36,871
Is Ms. Shin Ha-ri here?

137
00:09:37,497 --> 00:09:38,539
That's me.

138
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:41,375
What is it?

139
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,628
Your boyfriend sent you a gift.

140
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:44,962
Boyfriend?

141
00:09:50,384 --> 00:09:51,719
Could you sign here?

142
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,314
What is it?

143
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:06,192
Ms. Shin, are you dating someone
in secret?

144
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:08,319
What's the gift? Let me see.

145
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:10,404
Let's see.

146
00:10:10,988 --> 00:10:12,490
What? They're heels.

147
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:16,118
Right! You've been upset today
because you wore mismatched shoes.

148
00:10:16,202 --> 00:10:19,413
What? Then did your boyfriend
send these knowing about that?

149
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,834
I think Young-seo sent these.

150
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:25,962
I sent her a text about it earlier,

151
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:28,256
so she must have decided
to play a joke on me.

152
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:31,008
Right. You mean
the daughter of Marine Group?

153
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:32,802
-Yes.
-Right? You had me going there.

154
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:35,263
That makes sense.
These are really expensive.

155
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:36,973
She really is rich.

156
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:45,856
The data shows
that the white kimchi ravioli

157
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,609
developed by Researcher Shin Ha-ri
and Chef Lee Min-woo

158
00:10:48,693 --> 00:10:50,444
had the highest sales rate.

159
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:53,489
Also, our future sales will
be positively impacted

160
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:55,366
by Ms. Shin's comment on our video…

161
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:58,119
<i>If it wasn't for this trip,
I'd go on a date with Ms. Shin.</i>

162
00:10:58,202 --> 00:11:00,788
<i>Should I delay the trip?
I shouldn't, right?</i>

163
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:04,959
This is driving me nuts.

164
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:09,046
President Kang, is there
something wrong with the report?

165
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:09,964
HA-RI! MS. SHIN

166
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:17,972
It's nothing. Please continue.

167
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:26,897
What's the occasion? You usually
only wear slippers while working.

168
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:29,150
Well, no reason.

169
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:33,029
I'm so tired.

170
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:36,782
Developing a new product
and renewing our existing products?

171
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:39,035
Why is this company
giving us so much work?

172
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:42,121
Thank you for your hard work.

173
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:44,165
Goodness.

174
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:47,710
You don't have to mention it, sir.

175
00:11:48,377 --> 00:11:50,546
This company is like my family,

176
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:52,590
and to work hard for it
is my joy and happiness.

177
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:56,844
-To what do we owe the pleasure?
-I have something to say

178
00:11:57,636 --> 00:11:58,471
to Ms. Shin.

179
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:01,599
To me?

180
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,687
What is it that you want to…

181
00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:16,822
I heard you've been busy lately
because of the video shoot.

182
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:19,367
Yes.

183
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,119
So I made some adjustments
to your schedule.

184
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:23,454
About the Bucket List Fish.

185
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:25,748
HA-RI! MS. SHIN

186
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:27,291
About the plan, I--

187
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:34,256
Sir, are you all right?

188
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,384
Ms. Shin, why did you do that?

189
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,761
Why is there a fly here?

190
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:41,013
-A fly?
-What do you mean, a fly?

191
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:42,640
It's thoroughly sanitized here.

192
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:44,892
No, I saw it too. A fly. There.

193
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:47,520
You'll be late for your flight.

194
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:50,564
Wait, I'll send you the schedule
by email via Team Leader Lee.

195
00:12:51,357 --> 00:12:52,191
A fly?

196
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,653
-Where is the fly?
-That's weird.

197
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:57,488
There's no way a fly is in here.

198
00:12:57,571 --> 00:13:00,157
By the way, isn't President Kang
acting weird today?

199
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:03,619
He kept smiling at Ms. Shin
as he was talking.

200
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,793
Naturally.

201
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,755
The sales have gone up thanks to Ms. Shin.
I bet he's really thankful.

202
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:16,298
True.

203
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:17,800
That's true.

204
00:13:17,883 --> 00:13:19,760
Right?

205
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:23,222
I bet he just can't help
but smile when he sees me.

206
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,604
What?

207
00:13:31,313 --> 00:13:33,941
Is she showing off now that he favors her?

208
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:35,484
Yes.

209
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,445
She says yes.

210
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:40,990
It's a pleasure to work with you

211
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:42,658
The pleasure is mine. Thank you.

212
00:13:42,742 --> 00:13:43,993
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

213
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:49,915
Right now, the time in Seoul…

214
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,334
It should be around eight.

215
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:54,462
She must've gotten off work, right?

216
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:58,674
I really don't know anymore.

217
00:13:58,758 --> 00:14:01,051
I think that it'll be best if you decide.

218
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:02,470
PRESIDENT KANG

219
00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:07,850
So I've been thinking, Ms. Shin.

220
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:15,608
Ms. Shin, you know that there's
no toilet paper in the bathroom, right?

221
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:29,580
What's the matter?

222
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:31,332
You surprised me.

223
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:35,294
No, go ahead and smoke.

224
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:37,963
Why is it so hard…

225
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:39,799
To take one call?

226
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:41,425
Why isn't she picking up now?

227
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:47,431
<i>If things didn't work out with Yu-jeong,</i>

228
00:14:47,515 --> 00:14:50,976
<i>then we need to
schedule your next blind date!</i>

229
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,437
<i>But you ran off
and went on a business trip!</i>

230
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:57,024
He's yelling at me
to go on a blind date again.

231
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:01,779
Should I just tell him
that I'm seeing Ms. Shin?

232
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:03,364
Then…

233
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:06,408
you'll have to tell him
Shin Geum-hui is Shin Ha-ri

234
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:08,869
and explain everything that's happened.

235
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,080
Will it be okay?

236
00:15:20,297 --> 00:15:23,926
<i>Mr. Cha, are you busy?
Why aren't you checking my texts?</i>

237
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:26,345
<i>Please text me back.</i>

238
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,889
<i>Please?</i>

239
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:33,686
<i>I thought I ended things that day,
so why is she doing this?</i>

240
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:39,191
President Kang has someone else
that he wishes to marry.

241
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:41,110
I'm very sorry.

242
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:43,904
Oh, my god.

243
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:47,867
This is destiny.

244
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,159
It's fate.

245
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:50,160
What?

246
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,037
What are you--

247
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:54,957
You're totally my type.

248
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,919
Do you want to date me?

249
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:01,672
That…

250
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,341
won't be possible.

251
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:06,677
Why? Am I not your type?
Or are you married?

252
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,220
It's not like that.

253
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:09,680
I have a girlfriend.

254
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:12,683
Who cares?

255
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:15,728
You're not even married,
so it doesn't matter.

256
00:16:16,312 --> 00:16:17,646
Let's just give it a try.

257
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,024
I'll give up
if you don't change your mind.

258
00:16:20,107 --> 00:16:21,525
Okay?

259
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:23,861
I don't think I can.

260
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:26,238
I'm very sorry.

261
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:29,450
Come on.

262
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:44,798
Yes, Ms. Jin.

263
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:48,594
You must be busy because of work, right?
Still, don't skip any meals, okay?

264
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:51,597
Why is he ignoring my text?
Is he really busy?

265
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,642
Yes, okay. I'll call you later.

266
00:16:56,977 --> 00:17:01,398
You're not wearing
anything that's the same as me today!

267
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:05,611
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

268
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:06,654
<i>I'm on a business trip.</i>

269
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:09,073
<i>I'll contact you when I'm back,
so stop texting me.</i>

270
00:17:09,156 --> 00:17:11,659
<i>Don't skip your meals too, Young-seo.</i>

271
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:15,704
He'll contact me when he's back.

272
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:16,830
Thank goodness.

273
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:21,168
Did something good happen?
You look so happy.

274
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:22,836
I could say the same thing.

275
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,339
It seems like you have something
that makes you so happy.

276
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:28,634
Haven't I told you?

277
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:30,302
I'm…

278
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:33,097
seeing someone.

279
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,139
Really?

280
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:38,018
Oh, my! I am too!

281
00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:55,744
<i>Ms. Han, Mr. Shin.</i>

282
00:17:55,828 --> 00:17:58,372
Congratulations on being discharged
from the hospital.

283
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,583
There's no need to bow.

284
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,169
I'm sorry I didn't visit
you two at the hospital.

285
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:06,839
We know that it's because you were busy.

286
00:18:06,922 --> 00:18:08,590
-Mom, did we have guests?
-Yes.

287
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:11,176
The people from your dad's hiking club
and my friends.

288
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:13,303
Oh, right. Ha-ri.

289
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:17,558
People asked me
to get them your autograph.

290
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:22,521
Dong-cheol's son became your fan
after watching the YouTube video.

291
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:23,647
That's ridiculous.

292
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:25,441
What? It's not that weird.

293
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:28,110
You're even doing an interview tomorrow.
With Min-woo.

294
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:29,737
An interview?

295
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:32,406
My daughter is pretty impressive!

296
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:33,323
I'm not.

297
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:37,411
My company's marketing team arranged it.
It's a small online article.

298
00:18:37,494 --> 00:18:39,621
By the way,
why hasn't Min-woo been around?

299
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:40,748
Is he really busy?

300
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:42,708
I think so.

301
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,711
What? What am I doing? It's time.

302
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:46,920
It's time.

303
00:18:47,004 --> 00:18:48,589
Gosh, I thought he was in pain.

304
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:49,715
That's how he is.

305
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:50,966
Do you watch this, Dad?

306
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,051
What?

307
00:18:52,134 --> 00:18:53,635
You watch this show, too?

308
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:54,970
I heard it's nuts.

309
00:18:55,054 --> 00:18:57,765
He watched every episode in the hospital

310
00:18:57,848 --> 00:19:00,350
and now he's crazy about it.
He likes it more than I do.

311
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:03,812
<i>BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI</i>

312
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:05,022
Hey, Ha-ri.

313
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:07,566
That's the cafe
that your company launched, right?

314
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:09,568
They're so openly advertising it.

315
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:13,405
And what kind of rich person
goes to a franchise coffee shop

316
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:15,032
and picks up his own coffee?

317
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:17,493
Does that make any sense, Young-seo?

318
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:18,952
Rich people are human too.

319
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:20,621
Just look at Young-seo.

320
00:19:20,704 --> 00:19:23,082
She eats <i>tteokbokki</i>
and fried chicken like us.

321
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:24,416
Is that so?

322
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,418
Well, Young-seo's an exception.

323
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:29,546
Come on, I'm trying
to watch the show here.

324
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,714
All right.

325
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:35,177
<i>Chairman Kang goes to roadside
steamed bun places too.</i>

326
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:38,388
You got some red beans on your teeth.

327
00:19:38,472 --> 00:19:40,182
My teeth? Oh, my!

328
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:43,310
I saw that scene yesterday too.

329
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:50,984
So what did you want to tell me?

330
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:54,738
I see that President Kang
hasn't told you, either.

331
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:57,825
Kids these days.

332
00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:00,035
Apparently…

333
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:02,412
the two of them

334
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:04,873
are seeing each other.

335
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:05,833
What?

336
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,668
Are you sure?

337
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:10,546
Yes, absolutely.

338
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:13,048
Yu-jeong said

339
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:16,343
that she's very busy
dating someone lately.

340
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:20,722
Wait, then is she really seeing Tae-moo?

341
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:22,349
I'm sure of it.

342
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:27,396
So I was thinking,
before people start talking about it,

343
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:31,233
what do you think
about getting those two married?

344
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:32,317
What?

345
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,084
Hey. It's been a while.

346
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:51,128
Yes, it has.

347
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,049
Ha-ri, I'm sorry about that day.

348
00:20:57,134 --> 00:21:00,095
I overstepped my boundaries
because I was so worried about you.

349
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,389
I'm so sorry.

350
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,600
It's okay.

351
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:06,685
I thought about it and I overreacted, too.

352
00:21:07,895 --> 00:21:10,355
And you must have been surprised too.

353
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:14,651
What did you and President Kang
decide to do?

354
00:21:15,736 --> 00:21:16,612
We're…

355
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:19,281
seeing each other.

356
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:24,244
Really?

357
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:27,164
Of course, like you said, the two of us

358
00:21:27,873 --> 00:21:29,750
might not work out.

359
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:32,920
But I decided to give it a try.

360
00:21:36,757 --> 00:21:38,550
Onto the next question.

361
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:42,638
Ms. Shin, you're famous for
the "Is President Kang Watching?" meme.

362
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:44,848
Did President Kang really see it?

363
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:46,141
Yes, he did.

364
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:48,477
Then did he give you a bonus?

365
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,145
-No.
-He didn't?

366
00:21:50,228 --> 00:21:52,064
-No, he didn't.
-He's so cheap.

367
00:21:53,148 --> 00:21:54,358
I can't believe it.

368
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,321
Ms. Shin, on a side note,

369
00:21:59,404 --> 00:22:01,740
is President Kang really that handsome?

370
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:03,659
I've only seen him in pictures.

371
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:09,665
Well, I'm not so sure.

372
00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:12,668
You keep asking questions
that are hard to answer.

373
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:13,877
President Kang.

374
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:15,754
President Kang.

375
00:22:15,837 --> 00:22:17,965
Hello, President Kang Tae-moo.

376
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:20,092
I'm Hwang Bo-ra, a reporter for Estien.

377
00:22:20,175 --> 00:22:21,551
It's nice to meet you.

378
00:22:21,635 --> 00:22:22,469
Here.

379
00:22:23,762 --> 00:22:25,347
It's been a while, you two.

380
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,892
Since you're here,
could you say a few words--

381
00:22:28,976 --> 00:22:30,727
I'm sorry, but I don't think so.

382
00:22:30,811 --> 00:22:33,105
I think a question or two will be fine.

383
00:22:33,188 --> 00:22:35,816
This question is similar to the one
I just asked Ms. Shin.

384
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:38,026
Are you going to give Ms. Shin a bonus?

385
00:22:38,777 --> 00:22:39,945
Of course.

386
00:22:40,028 --> 00:22:42,030
I need to keep my promise as a president.

387
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:44,199
And, Ms. Shin,

388
00:22:45,117 --> 00:22:47,327
-do you want to have dinner with me today?
-What?

389
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:49,663
What? Dinner with Ms. Shin?

390
00:22:49,746 --> 00:22:51,665
What's going on?

391
00:22:51,748 --> 00:22:54,835
At our last company field day,
Ms. Shin was chosen as the MVP

392
00:22:54,918 --> 00:22:57,713
-and won a chance to eat dinner with me.
-Right.

393
00:22:58,588 --> 00:23:00,590
So let's have that dinner today.

394
00:23:00,674 --> 00:23:01,717
Do you have the time?

395
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,261
Yes, I do.

396
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:30,912
Where are you meeting him?

397
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:33,123
At a restaurant, I'm sure.
But which restaurant?

398
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:34,833
Probably a really fancy one, right?

399
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:37,044
Well, I don't know either.

400
00:23:37,127 --> 00:23:38,295
The place doesn't matter.

401
00:23:38,378 --> 00:23:41,048
Just imagine eating dinner
with a guy like President Kang.

402
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:42,507
It would feel like a date.

403
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:44,009
A date, my foot.

404
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:46,011
I bet you'll feel really uncomfortable.

405
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,603
I was going to come get you. Get in.

406
00:23:55,437 --> 00:23:57,105
Yes. Right…

407
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:00,942
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

408
00:24:02,194 --> 00:24:04,112
Why? Wait, get in.

409
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:07,074
I'm in front of my place.

410
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:10,285
<i>I'm almost there, too.
Why don't we have dinner together?</i>

411
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:11,912
Sure.

412
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:13,705
I'll be waiting, then.

413
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:15,499
Okay.

414
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:21,671
Long time, no see, Mr. Cha.

415
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:24,007
Ms. Cho, what are you doing here?

416
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:28,929
In this Information Age,

417
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:33,016
you can find out anything
you put your mind to.

418
00:24:39,106 --> 00:24:40,440
Mr. Cha.

419
00:24:41,024 --> 00:24:42,734
Why won't you like me back?

420
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:46,238
As I told you before,

421
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:47,948
I'm not interested in you.

422
00:24:48,782 --> 00:24:52,953
I simply can't give up on you!

423
00:24:54,746 --> 00:24:55,789
Please.

424
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,460
Please reciprocate my feelings! Please?

425
00:25:03,046 --> 00:25:04,297
Are you feeling okay?

426
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:17,352
Sung-hoon, it's me.

427
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:19,020
Open the door.

428
00:25:26,444 --> 00:25:27,279
You're here.

429
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:29,948
I thought you'd want a home-cooked meal,
so I bought groceries.

430
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:33,743
My house is a bit dirty to cook in,
so let's cook at your place.

431
00:25:33,827 --> 00:25:37,539
I don't think that's a good idea.

432
00:25:37,622 --> 00:25:40,792
Why? Your house is a lot better
than mine. It's okay.

433
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:47,090
What's that noise?

434
00:25:47,174 --> 00:25:48,758
President Kang is here.

435
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:51,011
Mr. Kang Tae-moo?

436
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,888
It's Kang Tae-moo again?

437
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:57,392
I'll call you as soon as I can
after I take care of him.

438
00:26:00,395 --> 00:26:02,105
Just go wait at home, okay?

439
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:04,107
-Okay, call me.
-Sure.

440
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:06,193
Yes. I'll call you as soon as I can.

441
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,781
In any case,

442
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:14,451
I really don't like Kang Tae-moo.

443
00:26:15,702 --> 00:26:19,331
<i>TTEOKBOKKI</i>, FRIES, <i>SUNDAE</i>, FISH CAKES
MATNA SNACK BAR

444
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,794
Is this really the place
you wanted to go to with me?

445
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:25,795
Yes.

446
00:26:26,963 --> 00:26:29,090
What are you doing? Let's go.

447
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,510
I can't believe her.

448
00:26:38,683 --> 00:26:40,227
A date in a place like this?

449
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,605
This isn't a date.
This is a dinner with President Kang.

450
00:26:43,688 --> 00:26:44,940
It's an excuse for a date.

451
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:48,610
Honestly, it felt good to say it
in front of other people

452
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:50,946
after hiding it for so long.

453
00:26:52,322 --> 00:26:54,491
Do you know how surprised I was
because of that?

454
00:26:54,574 --> 00:26:56,826
All of the employees came out to watch.

455
00:26:57,494 --> 00:26:59,829
I was just happy to see you
after such a long time.

456
00:26:59,913 --> 00:27:01,539
Are you really so unhappy about it?

457
00:27:01,623 --> 00:27:02,832
I mean,

458
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:07,462
I'm just saying
that we should be careful at work.

459
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:11,424
Is that why you treated
your boyfriend's call like some spam call?

460
00:27:11,508 --> 00:27:12,884
That's not it.

461
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:16,263
Then what should I do?

462
00:27:16,346 --> 00:27:19,641
Should I go around telling people
I'm dating the president of my company?

463
00:27:20,267 --> 00:27:22,769
You're here. It's been a while.

464
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:25,146
Hi, ma'am, have you been well?

465
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,815
Of course.

466
00:27:26,898 --> 00:27:30,151
By the way, who's this?
I've never seen him before.

467
00:27:30,235 --> 00:27:31,236
He's my company's…

468
00:27:34,322 --> 00:27:35,240
He's my boyfriend.

469
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:37,033
What?

470
00:27:37,117 --> 00:27:39,786
When did you get
such a handsome boyfriend?

471
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:42,122
Okay.

472
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:45,083
I'll give you two some <i>sundae</i>,
free of charge.

473
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,294
You don't have to.

474
00:27:47,377 --> 00:27:48,670
Thank you.

475
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:50,088
Ma'am.

476
00:27:50,171 --> 00:27:52,549
Why is she the only one
getting free <i>sundae</i>?

477
00:27:52,632 --> 00:27:53,633
We want some, too.

478
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:55,051
Yes, give us some.

479
00:27:55,135 --> 00:27:56,803
-We want some, too.
-We want <i>sundae</i>.

480
00:27:56,886 --> 00:28:02,684
-We want some too.
-We want some too.

481
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:03,727
Students, listen!

482
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:10,317
Since the owner is giving us <i>sundae</i>,
I'll pay for all of your food.

483
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,318
How does that sound?

484
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:15,113
-Great!
-Great!

485
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,539
I'll contact you tomorrow then.

486
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:31,713
Sorry. I keep getting work calls.

487
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:34,841
Why are you laughing like that?

488
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:37,844
The more I think about it,
the funnier it is.

489
00:28:38,762 --> 00:28:42,474
I've never seen someone pay
for everyone's food at a snack bar.

490
00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:48,271
It's my first time spending
that much money at a snack bar too.

491
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:51,650
Did you eat that much
when you were in high school too?

492
00:28:52,984 --> 00:28:54,235
I'm not sure.

493
00:28:57,364 --> 00:28:59,949
Anyway, it felt good

494
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:04,329
when you introduced me
as your boyfriend to the owner.

495
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,542
Do you think that I always want
to hide it from other people?

496
00:29:12,962 --> 00:29:15,215
"President Kang is my boyfriend."

497
00:29:15,757 --> 00:29:18,802
I want to say that confidently.

498
00:29:26,518 --> 00:29:28,520
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

499
00:29:30,897 --> 00:29:33,233
There's something I've been wanting to do.

500
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:35,443
Can I?

501
00:29:36,528 --> 00:29:37,696
What?

502
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:03,012
You had some sauce on your cheek,
so I was going to wipe it for you.

503
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:05,181
Why did you close your eyes?

504
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:09,352
My eyes were stinging.

505
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:08,244
<i>Why isn't he saying anything to me
when he's seeing Yu-jeong?</i>

506
00:31:19,255 --> 00:31:21,132
-Why are you staring at me?
-What?

507
00:31:21,758 --> 00:31:22,967
No. It's nothing.

508
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:28,473
<i>Is it because he's embarrassed
it hasn't been that long</i>

509
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:30,433
<i>since he broke up with Geum-hui?</i>

510
00:31:31,142 --> 00:31:34,646
<i>Should I just pretend not to know
for the time being?</i>

511
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:44,572
Oh, my God.

512
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:46,658
You scared me.

513
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:55,667
What do you want?

514
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,626
Can I

515
00:31:57,377 --> 00:31:59,254
vent to you for a moment?

516
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:04,592
I don't think we're close enough
to listen to each other's stories.

517
00:32:04,676 --> 00:32:06,636
It's because
I don't have anyone to talk to!

518
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:09,556
You know I have no friends!

519
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:10,974
Okay.

520
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:16,729
Seriously.

521
00:32:19,357 --> 00:32:20,525
What's wrong?

522
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:24,821
You know the guy
that I told you about before?

523
00:32:25,738 --> 00:32:28,199
It's over!

524
00:32:28,283 --> 00:32:30,869
What? It hasn't even been that long. Why?

525
00:32:31,536 --> 00:32:36,499
Last night, I went to his place all drunk,
and I made a huge scene!

526
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:39,544
You go wild when you're drunk.

527
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:41,004
Why did you do that?

528
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:42,547
Because…

529
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:46,509
he kept trying to draw lines with me.

530
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:51,014
-Draw lines?
-I'm saying this only to you,

531
00:32:51,764 --> 00:32:55,059
but that guy is not on our level.

532
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:57,937
He's just a normal guy.

533
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,732
It's the first time
I've fallen for someone

534
00:33:00,815 --> 00:33:05,028
without caring
about his family, assets, or background.

535
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:08,197
But now…

536
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:11,701
the end.

537
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:14,829
It's game over!

538
00:33:33,598 --> 00:33:36,225
So, you're just going to give up?

539
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,894
What?

540
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:39,854
Where's the Yu-jeong that I know?

541
00:33:39,938 --> 00:33:43,107
You're the kind of person
who never gives up and tries

542
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:45,485
until they like you back. Right?

543
00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:47,153
Right.

544
00:33:47,737 --> 00:33:51,741
Actually, I had to be really persistent
to get with my current boyfriend

545
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:54,786
because he kept trying
to keep his distance.

546
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,829
Are you kidding? Really?

547
00:33:56,913 --> 00:33:57,747
It's true.

548
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,665
Oh, my god.

549
00:33:58,748 --> 00:34:02,710
So you should go and apologize to him
and try to make it work.

550
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:04,879
You got this. You can do it, girl!

551
00:34:04,963 --> 00:34:06,130
I can do it!

552
00:34:06,214 --> 00:34:07,256
You got this!

553
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:14,013
Yes, you can do it.

554
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:22,271
I'm sorry I'm late.
There were so many customers.

555
00:34:22,355 --> 00:34:24,357
It seemed busier than usual today.

556
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:26,901
Maybe it's because of that news article.

557
00:34:26,985 --> 00:34:28,695
-Did you read it?
-Of course.

558
00:34:29,821 --> 00:34:31,197
You looked great in the photo.

559
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:35,243
A lot of comments say
you two look so good together.

560
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:37,370
You know how people are.

561
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:38,413
Right.

562
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:41,666
By the way,

563
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:43,334
do you have time this weekend?

564
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:44,252
This weekend? Why?

565
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:45,670
My parents want to see you.

566
00:34:46,462 --> 00:34:50,049
I think they're worried since we keep
breaking up and getting back together.

567
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:53,845
And I also think
it's about time we got married.

568
00:34:58,057 --> 00:34:59,600
Why aren't you saying anything?

569
00:35:07,692 --> 00:35:10,486
<i>Let's put off meeting with your parents.</i>

570
00:35:11,362 --> 00:35:13,614
I'm so busy with work these days,

571
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:15,575
and I don't think…

572
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:18,828
I'm ready for that yet.

573
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,919
Did something happen yesterday?

574
00:35:27,003 --> 00:35:28,337
What? Why?

575
00:35:28,421 --> 00:35:31,591
You look upset, so I was wondering
if you fought with Young-seo.

576
00:35:33,259 --> 00:35:35,219
Actually, I have something to…

577
00:35:37,055 --> 00:35:38,056
What?

578
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:39,098
What is it?

579
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:40,767
You look like you've seen a ghost.

580
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:42,351
What?

581
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:44,395
Mr. Cha.

582
00:35:50,193 --> 00:35:51,444
Who…

583
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:53,279
Hello.

584
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:57,742
I'm Jo Yu-jeong. The one you were supposed
to go on a blind date with.

585
00:35:59,285 --> 00:36:00,828
What brings you here?

586
00:36:00,912 --> 00:36:01,788
Okay.

587
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:04,791
Actually…

588
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:10,838
I fell in love at first sight with
Mr. Cha, who showed up to the blind date

589
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:13,341
instead of you.

590
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,804
But Mr. Cha wouldn't
reciprocate my feelings,

591
00:36:18,471 --> 00:36:22,058
so I went to his place last night
after getting drunk.

592
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:25,019
-Please, don't.
-Don't be so startled.

593
00:36:26,229 --> 00:36:28,856
I thought about it,
and it was such a big mistake.

594
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,111
So I'm here to apologize.

595
00:36:33,194 --> 00:36:35,363
What is she talking about?

596
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:37,782
Mr. Kang.

597
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:38,741
Grandfather.

598
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:42,662
So, this is Ms. Jo Yu-jeong.

599
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:44,914
And you went on that blind date

600
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,543
instead of Tae-moo?

601
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,419
That's--

602
00:36:51,504 --> 00:36:54,507
I think I came at a bad time again.

603
00:36:56,968 --> 00:36:58,052
What?

604
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:01,639
You little brat.

605
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:03,516
-Come here!
-Grandpa!

606
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,725
-You!
-Sir!

607
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:07,019
-Grandfather, calm down.
-Sir, I'm Sung-hoon!

608
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:09,897
-You went instead of him? You brat!
-It's me, Sung-hoon.

609
00:37:15,153 --> 00:37:17,280
Tae-moo, you really…

610
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,033
Then…

611
00:37:22,285 --> 00:37:24,287
who's the woman

612
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:26,497
you've been seeing?

613
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:27,498
What?

614
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:29,667
What woman?

615
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,377
Do you think that I don't know?

616
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,839
I've heard you calling her every night.

617
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:39,302
If it's not Ms. Jo,
then who's the person you've been seeing?

618
00:37:41,554 --> 00:37:43,055
-That's--
-Wait.

619
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,309
Are you seeing Geum-hui again?

620
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:54,650
Why aren't you saying anything?

621
00:37:57,695 --> 00:38:00,406
My stomach. What's wrong with it?

622
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:02,491
Are you not feeling well, sir?

623
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:05,244
Of course, I'm not feeling well!
Because of this brat!

624
00:38:05,328 --> 00:38:09,081
It must be because you keep
drinking cold drinks for the menu renewal.

625
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:11,250
You be quiet!

626
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:20,384
Tae-moo.

627
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,346
I need to use the bathroom.

628
00:38:24,013 --> 00:38:27,141
Stop the elevator on any floor.

629
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:31,938
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 1

630
00:38:32,021 --> 00:38:34,774
Ms. Yeo, here's the data
that you asked for.

631
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:35,691
Okay.

632
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:40,154
Ms. Shin's proposal was chosen
for our newest product!

633
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:42,240
Yes.

634
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:48,120
Mr. Gye. Your proposal was good,

635
00:38:48,204 --> 00:38:50,331
but it's too similar to a product

636
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:53,626
that another company sold
about three years ago.

637
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:56,754
So I excluded it
because I didn't want people saying

638
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:57,964
that we copied it.

639
00:38:58,047 --> 00:38:59,340
So don't be too sad.

640
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:03,302
Right. Nowadays, people are so quick
to criticize if anything seems wrong.

641
00:39:03,386 --> 00:39:04,720
So we need to be careful.

642
00:39:04,804 --> 00:39:05,763
Copy? Whatever…

643
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:11,143
Of course.

644
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:14,981
I'm sure that you made the best decision.

645
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:24,115
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

646
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,458
Mr. Gye, what's this?

647
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:35,501
What?

648
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,131
<i>You're being harsh, babe.</i>

649
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:43,592
<i>Do you think I copied it?
You made me look bad in front of Ms. Kim.</i>

650
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:48,306
You sent this in the group chat?

651
00:39:49,974 --> 00:39:52,310
Don't tell me you two are…

652
00:39:55,396 --> 00:39:56,647
No, this is…

653
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:59,984
I was going to say something else,
but I made a typo and typed "babe."

654
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:02,194
I don't know anymore!

655
00:40:02,278 --> 00:40:03,112
Babe!

656
00:40:04,113 --> 00:40:05,072
I mean, "hey."

657
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:06,407
Mr. Gye!

658
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,455
What's wrong with Mr. Gye?

659
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:13,748
What's he talking about?

660
00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:16,125
Mr. Gye.

661
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,543
We need to talk!

662
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:19,211
I have nothing to say to you.

663
00:40:19,295 --> 00:40:20,338
Let go!

664
00:40:20,421 --> 00:40:21,297
It hurts!

665
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:25,509
How am I supposed to come to work now?

666
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:28,804
Mr. Gye!

667
00:40:29,472 --> 00:40:31,057
Wait, Ms. Yeo…

668
00:40:32,183 --> 00:40:34,518
Ms. Yeo, that's the men's bathroom.

669
00:40:34,602 --> 00:40:35,811
Come on.

670
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:38,773
Calm down. Let's talk.

671
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:40,858
-I don't want to talk with you!
-Come on!

672
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:41,859
I want to be alone!

673
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:44,028
Ms. Yeo!

674
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:45,738
What if someone sees you?

675
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:47,323
I mean, seriously…

676
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:51,160
-Ms. Yeo, are you all right?
-She's too strong!

677
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:52,787
-Are you okay?
-That jerk!

678
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,497
Are you two…

679
00:40:58,292 --> 00:40:59,168
Damn it.

680
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:00,294
Sir, this way.

681
00:41:00,378 --> 00:41:02,129
I can see, too.

682
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:05,591
-Don't get in the way. Move.
-Chairman Kang?

683
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:13,307
Wait,

684
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:17,561
why is there a women's shoe
in the men's bathroom?

685
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:19,688
You're right. Why is this here?

686
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:23,526
Wait a minute.

687
00:41:24,402 --> 00:41:26,904
What if there's a woman in here?

688
00:41:30,282 --> 00:41:32,618
Hey, who's in there?

689
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:34,203
Say something.

690
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:35,830
What?

691
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:38,165
I was right.

692
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:41,961
But why is a woman in the men's bathroom?

693
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:43,629
She must be in here by mistake.

694
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:46,340
If you do this,
she'll be too embarrassed to come out.

695
00:41:46,424 --> 00:41:48,217
You should go to another bathroom.

696
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,927
No!

697
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,389
The person who shouldn't be in here
should leave. Why should I?

698
00:41:57,768 --> 00:42:02,231
Listen. Come on out
before it gets even more embarrassing.

699
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:14,118
I'm sorry.

700
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:16,078
Look.

701
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:19,039
How did you end up in the men's…

702
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,419
Wait, Shin Ha-ri?

703
00:42:25,713 --> 00:42:30,009
You're the employee who shoved me
at the bathroom last time, right?

704
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:31,719
I'm sorry.

705
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:35,347
Why are you in the men's bathroom?

706
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:43,189
Okay, just get out.

707
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:45,107
Quickly!

708
00:42:45,191 --> 00:42:46,317
I'm sorry.

709
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:49,445
Jeez.

710
00:42:57,903 --> 00:42:59,654
LETTER OF APOLOGY
NAME: SHIN HA-RI

711
00:43:01,198 --> 00:43:05,243
Why did Chairman Kang
have to go into that bathroom?

712
00:43:05,952 --> 00:43:10,123
Right. You're so unlucky.

713
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,585
Ms. Shin's in trouble because of you two.

714
00:43:14,586 --> 00:43:16,296
So how long have you been dating?

715
00:43:18,757 --> 00:43:19,925
Babe, you should tell…

716
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,512
You should tell them, Ms. Yeo.

717
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:27,557
Well…

718
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:30,519
On the day of the field day,

719
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:33,688
<i>he and I went for drinks
after it was over.</i>

720
00:43:33,772 --> 00:43:35,315
Damn blind date.

721
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,193
Fine, I'll go.

722
00:43:39,444 --> 00:43:40,821
I'm hanging up.

723
00:43:43,365 --> 00:43:44,741
It's so stressful.

724
00:43:52,165 --> 00:43:54,209
Didn't you say
you can't eat chicken gizzards?

725
00:43:55,419 --> 00:43:57,546
You always gave them to me.
What are you doing?

726
00:43:57,629 --> 00:44:00,424
You're going on a blind date?
Then I won't yield to you anymore.

727
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:01,550
What?

728
00:44:01,633 --> 00:44:04,344
What do chicken gizzards
have to do with that?

729
00:44:07,722 --> 00:44:09,891
Do you really think I can't eat them?

730
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:13,770
I like chicken gizzards,
and I like spicy marinated crabs, too.

731
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:16,606
But since you like them,

732
00:44:18,608 --> 00:44:20,819
I pretended not to eat them
and gave them to you.

733
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:22,696
What?

734
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,825
But you didn't know any of that,
and now you're going on a blind date.

735
00:44:28,034 --> 00:44:29,661
I think you're really drunk.

736
00:44:30,745 --> 00:44:32,664
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

737
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:36,877
Hey, Yeo Ui-joo,

738
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,253
I'm not drunk,

739
00:44:38,837 --> 00:44:40,088
so listen closely.

740
00:44:41,089 --> 00:44:42,174
Don't go…

741
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:45,510
on that blind date.

742
00:44:59,316 --> 00:45:01,193
<i>Stop!</i>

743
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:08,283
It's fine. You can stop there.

744
00:45:09,117 --> 00:45:10,410
Whatever.

745
00:45:12,704 --> 00:45:13,788
Hey, Ms. Shin.

746
00:45:14,873 --> 00:45:18,752
Could you just write that you went into
the men's bathroom accidentally?

747
00:45:20,045 --> 00:45:21,755
I was going to do that anyway.

748
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:23,089
Thanks, Ms. Shin.

749
00:45:24,424 --> 00:45:26,676
I'll buy you beef today.

750
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,928
Prime beef.

751
00:45:30,347 --> 00:45:32,390
<i>He must hate me now.</i>

752
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:35,560
Today, I…

753
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:38,980
<i>Today, I accidentally made
the mistake of going into</i>

754
00:45:39,064 --> 00:45:42,651
<i>the men's bathroom
because I was looking at my phone.</i>

755
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,490
<i>I will deeply repent for causing
Chairman Kang great mental distress</i>

756
00:45:48,573 --> 00:45:51,159
<i>and am submitting
this letter of apology as a promise</i>

757
00:45:51,243 --> 00:45:54,329
<i>that I will never
walk around looking at my phone again.</i>

758
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:01,002
Are you happy now that
you've gotten that letter of apology?

759
00:46:01,086 --> 00:46:03,630
So why did you just let her go?

760
00:46:03,713 --> 00:46:07,968
I was going to give her
a really good scolding.

761
00:46:08,885 --> 00:46:12,055
It seemed like a simple mistake.
You should just let it go, sir.

762
00:46:12,138 --> 00:46:14,099
A mistake or not,

763
00:46:14,182 --> 00:46:17,936
I hate that I keep getting
mixed up with her.

764
00:46:20,188 --> 00:46:21,398
I don't like it!

765
00:46:29,698 --> 00:46:32,450
I told you we should have a team dinner.
Why are you leaving?

766
00:46:32,534 --> 00:46:34,619
I'm good.
I don't feel like drinking today.

767
00:46:34,703 --> 00:46:37,289
Since when did you need
to feel like drinking to drink?

768
00:46:37,372 --> 00:46:38,873
-Let's go, Ms. Shin.
-Yes.

769
00:46:39,457 --> 00:46:40,875
Don't be like this.

770
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:43,044
Let's go to So's. I think that's the best.

771
00:46:43,128 --> 00:46:44,254
Yes.

772
00:46:44,337 --> 00:46:47,882
Let's chew on some beef,
and the chairman too.

773
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:51,094
I can't believe he made
you write a letter of apology.

774
00:46:51,177 --> 00:46:52,804
Yes, chew everything up!

775
00:46:52,887 --> 00:46:54,764
Let's all go to So's!

776
00:46:54,848 --> 00:46:56,266
Hello, President Kang.

777
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,727
Are you all going somewhere?

778
00:46:58,810 --> 00:46:59,644
Yes.

779
00:47:17,537 --> 00:47:19,581
-The enoki mushrooms are burning.
-What?

780
00:47:19,664 --> 00:47:21,082
Here.

781
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:22,083
My mistake.

782
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,968
I've never even imagined
that our busy president

783
00:47:32,052 --> 00:47:35,472
would come to a barbeque place with us
and grill meat like this.

784
00:47:50,236 --> 00:47:53,990
<i>Please leave. Everyone is uncomfortable
because of you.</i>

785
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:55,658
Am I making you uncomfortable?

786
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:59,412
Not at all. Why would we be uncomfortable?

787
00:47:59,496 --> 00:48:02,207
She's right! I couldn't be
more comfortable than this.

788
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,958
-Wait…
-Take off the cover.

789
00:48:12,133 --> 00:48:13,885
Mr. Kang, I have a suggestion.

790
00:48:14,511 --> 00:48:15,345
What is it?

791
00:48:15,428 --> 00:48:17,806
I think that we're all feeling
a bit awkward

792
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:20,183
because this is our first team dinner
with you.

793
00:48:20,266 --> 00:48:22,060
How about we each have a bomb shot?

794
00:48:22,977 --> 00:48:24,562
-What?
-Come on, Ms. Kim.

795
00:48:24,646 --> 00:48:27,941
Having bomb shots with the president?
Don't be so embarrassing.

796
00:48:28,024 --> 00:48:29,359
I like bomb shots.

797
00:48:31,111 --> 00:48:32,654
-Open it!
-Okay.

798
00:48:32,737 --> 00:48:34,280
-Swirl it.
-Open it?

799
00:48:34,364 --> 00:48:35,615
Yes.

800
00:48:38,952 --> 00:48:39,994
What?

801
00:48:45,667 --> 00:48:47,460
A WORKER'S GUIDE TO LIFE
1. HOW TO MIX BOMB SHOTS

802
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:09,732
The name of this drink that I made

803
00:49:10,942 --> 00:49:14,028
with my blood, sweat, and tears

804
00:49:16,114 --> 00:49:17,115
is…

805
00:49:20,535 --> 00:49:22,036
The Dynamite Drink!

806
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:27,375
Here!

807
00:49:32,005 --> 00:49:34,340
Go ahead and try one!

808
00:49:41,473 --> 00:49:45,727
-Drink!
-Drink!

809
00:49:49,355 --> 00:49:51,232
I'll arrive in about ten minutes.

810
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:52,817
Oh, my God.

811
00:49:52,901 --> 00:49:54,110
I'll see you later.

812
00:49:55,862 --> 00:49:56,905
What do you want now?

813
00:49:56,988 --> 00:49:58,406
It's your fault!

814
00:49:58,490 --> 00:49:59,866
What's my fault?

815
00:49:59,949 --> 00:50:02,285
I went to see him at work

816
00:50:02,368 --> 00:50:06,372
to sincerely apologize
because you told me to.

817
00:50:09,209 --> 00:50:12,712
But now I'm screwed!

818
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:26,392
Are you feeling nervous?

819
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:31,189
Yes. I'm introducing my girlfriend
to you for the first time after all.

820
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:33,608
Come on.

821
00:50:33,691 --> 00:50:36,152
You're making me all nervous too.

822
00:50:39,197 --> 00:50:41,157
I'm going to the bathroom for a moment.

823
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:43,159
Sure, go ahead.

824
00:50:49,249 --> 00:50:53,586
Sorry, you must've been waiting long.
Something came up on my way out.

825
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:55,004
It's all right.

826
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:56,297
-About today--
-I came

827
00:50:57,048 --> 00:50:58,299
with someone.

828
00:50:58,383 --> 00:50:59,217
Who?

829
00:51:00,843 --> 00:51:04,097
She got rejected by a guy,
so she was bawling.

830
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,391
And I couldn't just ignore her.

831
00:51:07,183 --> 00:51:09,435
I'm so sorry.

832
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:11,896
I really didn't want to be alone today,

833
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,107
so I followed her
even though I know it's rude…

834
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:25,118
What? Why?

835
00:51:26,744 --> 00:51:30,206
Mr. Cha is your boyfriend?

836
00:51:31,499 --> 00:51:32,584
Wait a second,

837
00:51:33,626 --> 00:51:35,378
the guy that you like…

838
00:51:36,462 --> 00:51:38,631
I had no idea.

839
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:44,679
Then you should have told me
in the beginning!

840
00:51:44,762 --> 00:51:46,681
I clearly told you I had a girlfriend!

841
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:51,185
Young-seo!

842
00:52:00,486 --> 00:52:01,988
My goodness.

843
00:52:02,071 --> 00:52:03,323
What's going on here?

844
00:52:07,869 --> 00:52:10,038
-Mother, just a second.
-What?

845
00:52:11,289 --> 00:52:12,373
Young-seo.

846
00:52:13,207 --> 00:52:14,292
Young-seo!

847
00:52:15,335 --> 00:52:17,795
Don't just leave like this.
Please let me explain.

848
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:19,172
Yesterday…

849
00:52:20,173 --> 00:52:23,384
when you said Kang Tae-moo was
at your place, was that Yu-jeong?

850
00:52:24,594 --> 00:52:25,845
Well, it was…

851
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,767
Yes, but let me explain.

852
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:32,894
I went on a blind date
instead of Mr. Kang--

853
00:52:32,977 --> 00:52:35,396
Yu-jeong fell for you
and started bothering you,

854
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,399
and things ended up like this. Right?

855
00:52:38,483 --> 00:52:40,818
-Yes, that's right.
-What do you mean, that's right?

856
00:52:40,902 --> 00:52:41,861
What?

857
00:52:41,944 --> 00:52:44,447
You shouldn't have
gone on that blind date.

858
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,824
You shouldn't have let Yu-jeong
into your house.

859
00:52:46,908 --> 00:52:50,703
No, you should have told me the truth
from the very beginning.

860
00:52:51,663 --> 00:52:55,208
I'm really sorry about everything.
It's all my fault.

861
00:52:55,291 --> 00:52:56,709
I didn't imagine things would--

862
00:52:56,793 --> 00:52:58,711
Do you know what's most infuriating?

863
00:52:58,795 --> 00:53:02,965
It's how you ignored me
and blindly did as Kang Tae-moo said.

864
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:04,634
Are you that family's servant?

865
00:53:09,847 --> 00:53:10,765
Young-seo…

866
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,952
Are you okay?
You seemed to be drinking a lot.

867
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:29,081
I wasn't. I drank
way less than I usually do.

868
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:31,959
Really?

869
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:37,339
Then, if you drink
more than you usually do…

870
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,847
what happens?

871
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,194
Seriously.

872
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:05,409
By the way…

873
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,289
about your grandfather…

874
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:15,252
Is he really not angry anymore?

875
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,339
He's still mad, right?

876
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,510
I knew it.

877
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,345
Don't worry about it too much.

878
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,389
He'll get over it.

879
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,808
How can I not worry about it?

880
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,185
He's your grandfather.

881
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:37,190
I want to be loved by the person

882
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,485
you love the most too.

883
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,909
Do you know you looked

884
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,163
really pretty when you said that?

885
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:57,753
Okay!

886
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,340
The others must be waiting.
Should we go back?

887
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:14,811
I sprayed too much.

888
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:16,772
I'm sorry.

889
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,899
Is Ms. Kim spinning?

890
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,109
-Really?
-Or are my eyes spinning?

891
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,322
Ms. Yeo.

892
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,700
Why are you drinking so little?

893
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,704
Let's go get another round of drinks.

894
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:36,041
We should go do karaoke next.

895
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,668
How's that?

896
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,710
I…

897
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:42,172
-President Kang, you're going too, right?
-Sure.

898
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,632
I'll pay for this

899
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,009
and for the second round too.

900
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:50,347
-President Kang!
-President Kang!

901
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:55,602
-President Kang!
-President Kang!

902
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,106
Three beats per measure. Let's go.

903
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,108
-President Kang!
-President Kang!

904
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,276
President Kang.

905
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,362
Three beats per measure.

906
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,197
Okay, empty your glasses.

907
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:17,165
What are you two doing holding hands?

908
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,253
Who's holding whose hand?

909
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,254
President Kang

910
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:24,840
and Ms. Shin.

911
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:27,676
They were just holding hands.

912
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:28,677
Look.

913
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,310
They're not holding hands anymore.

914
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,024
You're drunk.

915
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,693
Why would President Kang
and Ms. Shin be holding hands?

916
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,445
It's not like they're dating.

917
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,571
Right.

918
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:51,658
Ms. Yeo and Mr. Gye are the ones dating.

919
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:55,996
Are the two of you

920
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,706
in a relationship?

921
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,749
Yes.

922
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,542
It's been a while.

923
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,890
It's time you went home.
You're spewing nonsense.

924
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:15,891
Yes.

925
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:20,437
No, I'm sure that those two
were holding hands.

926
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,272
I'm right!

927
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,403
-Let's go.
-Go home!

928
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,322
Let's go home!

929
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,327
I swear I saw it.

930
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,913
I really saw it.

931
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,748
I'm serious!

932
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,168
Why are you being so insufferable today?

933
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,588
I'm sorry, sir.

934
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,256
It's all right.

935
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,716
She's drunk after all.

936
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,343
Should I call a taxi, then?

937
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,053
No. There's a lot over there.

938
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,971
Get home safe, President Kang.

939
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:56,431
We'll take care of this bomb…

940
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,266
I mean, send Ms. Kim home first.

941
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,601
Good night, then.

942
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,938
What about you, Ms. Shin?

943
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,273
What?

944
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:08,485
You're going in
the opposite direction, right? Bye, then.

945
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,028
Right. Yes.

946
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,114
Get home safe. Right.

947
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,242
Everyone is in a relationship except me!

948
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,828
Damn this world!

949
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:18,954
Shut it!

950
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,790
Her specialty is public speaking, you see.

951
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,584
-She has a good voice.
-Right.

952
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,719
What?

953
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,930
What is he doing there?

954
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,725
Do you want to go for a walk to sober up?

955
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,937
Sure.

956
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,194
What are you doing there?

957
00:59:11,767 --> 00:59:18,393
