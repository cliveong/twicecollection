BUSINESS PROPOSAL

00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:08,020
EPISODE 5

3
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,125
Hello?

4
00:00:21,337 --> 00:00:22,755
Hello? Mr. Kang?

5
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:30,179
What was that?

6
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:39,981
Why did he just hang up after calling me?

7
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:40,898
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
<i>A BUSINESS PROPOSAL</i>

8
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:42,775
It keeps bothering me.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,861
What's bothering you?

10
00:00:46,987 --> 00:00:47,988
Oh, nothing.

11
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:51,033
These abalones are so fresh.

12
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,952
Mom, Dad, come eat if you're done.

13
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:54,036
-Okay.
-Okay.

14
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,414
They look so good.

15
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:02,378
They're beautiful!

16
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,380
I should have bought some <i>Kaoliang</i> liquor.

17
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:07,425
You didn't have to do this.
These must have been expensive.

18
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:10,010
I remembered you craving them
the other day, Ms. Han.

19
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:12,805
Really? You're so sweet.

20
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:16,308
I wish you were my son
instead of this little brat.

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,272
Wait a second. You can still
become my son-in-law, Min-woo.

22
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:22,314
Mom, come on!

23
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:23,482
What?

24
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:24,483
That won't happen.

25
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:28,029
Young-seo told me that Min-woo
got back together with his ex-girlfriend.

26
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:29,530
You know, that one.

27
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:34,118
You broke up when she went
to study abroad, but you're back together?

28
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:35,286
Stop it.

29
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:36,412
Stop.

30
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:40,291
Oh, right. How could you
be so clumsy and drop your wallet?

31
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,002
-What?
-It was in front of the store.

32
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:47,339
When did I drop this?

33
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:59,351
EMPLOYEE PERSONNEL RECORD

34
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:00,269
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 1

35
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:02,271
She's been right under my nose.

36
00:02:02,897 --> 00:02:03,939
I went on a blind date

37
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,317
with an employee!

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,693
-Ms. Jin.
-Yes?

39
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:09,987
-What's your actual name?
-Geum… hui.

40
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:11,197
Geum-hui.

41
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:13,699
-Ms. Shin Ha-ri.
-I'm sorry.

42
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:16,202
-Will you present like that?
-Sir?

43
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,581
It's because I have a stye on my eye.

44
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:21,624
How dare she

45
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,417
fool me?

46
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:27,505
<i>You would get sick of me
If we spent every second together</i>

47
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:28,589
This is for you.

48
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:29,924
Very pretty.

49
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:33,219
Don't be like that.
Let's just get married.

50
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:41,018
Shin Ha-ri, Shin Geum-hui.

51
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:51,445
This is not right.

52
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:54,031
This isn't right!

53
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:57,993
GO FOOD

54
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:04,208
<i>Let's meet near your workplace for lunch.</i>

55
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:06,836
Near my workplace?

56
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:12,842
Near my workplace!

57
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:16,846
What's going to change
if I meet her in person?

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,105
I'm sorry I'm so late.

59
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,900
I had to go all the way to Gangnam
for a business meeting.

60
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:34,613
You work at a small company, right?

61
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,074
-What kind of company is it?
-What?

62
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:41,495
We produce all types of household goods.

63
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,914
What do you mean by
"all types of household goods"?

64
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,251
Like coffee mugs,

65
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:48,294
air fresheners,

66
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,337
tiepins, and so on.

67
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:53,257
They sure make a lot of things.

68
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:56,302
You must be so busy
working for a company like that.

69
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:58,345
Well, work is usually like that.

70
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:01,223
Our company tends to do anything
that will make a profit.

71
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,225
Anyway, why did you call me?

72
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,727
What Chinese characters

73
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,353
is your name derived from?

74
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:09,440
That's random. Why do you want to know?

75
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:10,733
I realized

76
00:04:12,443 --> 00:04:14,069
that I don't know much about you

77
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:18,782
while you know the schools I went to, the
company I work at, and even my hobbies.

78
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:22,494
Well, we're not actually dating.

79
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:25,039
Why do you need to know?

80
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:26,707
My grandfather could ask about it.

81
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:31,879
Well…

82
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:38,260
"Geum" means "iron"
and "hui" means "happiness."

83
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,888
<i>So she's going to keep lying to me?</i>

84
00:04:41,972 --> 00:04:44,433
You could have asked me
these things over the phone.

85
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:46,810
You hate wasting your time.

86
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:47,728
I do.

87
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:49,438
Shall we go, then?

88
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:51,232
What?

89
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:59,239
Did he really call me all the way to Ilsan
just to ask me that?

90
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:00,783
Wait…

91
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,035
Mr. Cha.

92
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:05,162
Schedule a meeting at two
with Food Product Development Team One.

93
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:08,749
Yes. There's no need to waste time.

94
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,879
Where do you work?

95
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:15,506
-If it's on the way, I can--
-No!

96
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:16,757
I can go by myself.

97
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,842
Then, I should get going. Goodbye!

98
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:34,608
Older customers are reacting favorably

99
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,652
because the main ingredient
is white kimchi.

100
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:38,570
My mother especially liked it.

101
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:40,656
She is a very picky eater, but seeing…

102
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:43,033
I'll draw more attention
if I go in right now.

103
00:05:43,117 --> 00:05:44,493
Ms. Shin, you're here!

104
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,620
Ms. Shin is here.

105
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,167
You're late, Ms. Shin.

106
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,838
What are you doing? Come in.

107
00:05:58,382 --> 00:05:59,925
Right.

108
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,809
Why are you so late?

109
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:11,603
He's been waiting
because he has something to say to you.

110
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:15,899
-What are you doing?
-Me? What do you need to say to me, sir?

111
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:18,318
I want you to re-do the ravioli, Ms. Shin.

112
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:20,320
Wait, why…

113
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,240
We got the highest ratings
at the tasting event--

114
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:24,533
The cost is too expensive.

115
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:26,702
Lower it by 20 percent.

116
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:30,289
If you lower it by 20 percent,
the quality of the product will…

117
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:34,126
Isn't it your job to lower the price
and improve the quality?

118
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:37,087
I thought that's what I pay you for.

119
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,298
Isn't that right, Ms. Shin?

120
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:42,134
-I--
-Don't you get what I'm saying?

121
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:44,053
As the developer of this product,

122
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:46,347
lower the price, keep the quality high,

123
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,642
balance the nutrition perfectly,
and make it commercially successful!

124
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:53,979
Do you understand?

125
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,108
Yes, sir.

126
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:15,918
What do you mean, remake the ravioli?

127
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:18,545
As Ms. Yeo said,
it was rated the highest at the tasting.

128
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:21,548
I'm the president of this company.
Is another reason necessary?

129
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:24,593
Well, it's very unlike you, sir.

130
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:28,680
And you also seem to be
treating Ms. Shin very emotionally.

131
00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:29,765
Mr. Cha.

132
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:33,477
Do you really not realize
who Shin Ha-ri is?

133
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:36,688
Who would she be?
Shin Ha-ri is Shin Ha-ri.

134
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:37,981
That Shin Ha-ri is…

135
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:42,986
Shin Geum-hui.

136
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,113
What?

137
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:47,950
What are you talking about?

138
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:51,286
-Is that really true?
-Yes.

139
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,830
I've already confirmed it.

140
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:53,789
Wait.

141
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,749
Just wait a second.

142
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,251
How is…

143
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:00,546
So what are you going to do now?

144
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:01,672
What do you think?

145
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:05,259
I'm going to take my time
to make her realize…

146
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:12,099
just how big of a mistake

147
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:14,893
she's made.

148
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:18,355
PRESIDENT KANG TAE-MOO

149
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:34,705
Again.

150
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:52,347
Again.

151
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:00,439
Again.

152
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,198
Again!

153
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:26,048
Again.

154
00:09:29,593 --> 00:09:30,427
Again.

155
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:39,811
Again!

156
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:41,688
Mr. Kang!

157
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:50,656
Please give me detailed feedback
on how you want it redone, sir!

158
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:57,955
I want you to redo it
until it's to my liking.

159
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,251
What do you…

160
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,307
You're going to make the white kimchi
all over again, now?

161
00:10:19,393 --> 00:10:20,644
Yes.

162
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:25,399
I'm going to make the kimchi
and take some time to think it over.

163
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,277
What a pity, really.

164
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,820
She's working so hard.

165
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:33,782
Hello.

166
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:34,825
-Hey.
-Oh, hello.

167
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:35,784
-Here.
-Thank you.

168
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:38,120
Chef Lee, what brings you here?

169
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:40,956
I have a meeting
with the marketing team, so I dropped by.

170
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,500
What are you doing, Ha-ri?
You're making kimchi?

171
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:45,961
Well…

172
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:53,510
Go ahead, eat!

173
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:54,678
Yes.

174
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:55,804
Please help yourselves.

175
00:10:57,306 --> 00:10:59,391
It's fine. Sit down.

176
00:10:59,474 --> 00:11:02,561
Everyone, relax, okay?
Take a seat, come on.

177
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:05,147
That's it. My goodness.

178
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:07,149
Hello, President Kang!

179
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:10,027
Chairman!

180
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:14,906
Why are they acting like that?

181
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,326
You must be working them to the bone.

182
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:19,286
They rushed out when they saw you.

183
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:20,412
It's not that.

184
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:23,415
They're acting that way
because you're here all of a sudden.

185
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:25,417
-Totally unannounced.
-Come on.

186
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,710
So what if I called?

187
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:28,754
All of the executives
would've come running.

188
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:32,049
I just didn't want
something annoying to happen.

189
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:34,009
That's why I came without calling.

190
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:37,429
Hey!

191
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:39,181
There's a new product!

192
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:40,098
Yes.

193
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:43,185
The vegetarian <i>jjajang</i> and
creme brûlée ready for trial production,

194
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:44,519
and the ravioli is…

195
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,064
undergoing some fine-tuning.

196
00:11:47,147 --> 00:11:48,940
That one started last, right?

197
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,234
Sounds like they're not making
a lot of progress.

198
00:11:51,318 --> 00:11:54,071
No. There was an unexpected problem.

199
00:11:54,154 --> 00:11:55,447
What problem?

200
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:00,327
Shin Ha-ri!

201
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,328
Ha-ri!

202
00:12:01,411 --> 00:12:04,873
That's the girl who made me
fall on my bum, right?

203
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:08,418
She looks just fine here,

204
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:11,671
so why did she go around
with her face covered like a ghost?

205
00:12:11,755 --> 00:12:13,799
I guess because of all the lies.

206
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:16,510
What? What did you say?

207
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:18,470
Hey, what do you mean?

208
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:20,138
-He said he's hungry.
-Is that so?

209
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:21,807
-Bring him some food then.
-Yes, sir.

210
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,433
Considering the way she acts,

211
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:26,103
that ravioli doesn't seem that good.

212
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:36,321
It looks like the food
is to your liking, sir.

213
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:38,865
Yes, it is.

214
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:43,370
Is the preparation for the Founding
Anniversary Ceremony going smoothly?

215
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:46,957
Yes, sir. We decided to have it
at our hotel, like last year,

216
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,127
and Mr. Yu Jae-seok
will be the moderator since you're a fan.

217
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,796
Really? Man, I really do like him.

218
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,424
What's his alter ego these days?

219
00:12:58,593 --> 00:13:01,805
I feel bad
that you're making the ravioli again.

220
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:05,350
No, the taste isn't the issue.
The problem is the price.

221
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:08,687
It's what all researchers do.
Don't worry about it.

222
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,106
Aren't you sick of it?
Let's eat out somewhere good.

223
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:14,401
It's fine. Let's eat here.
I want to see the reaction to our product.

224
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,363
But not many people are here.

225
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,283
That's weird.
This place is usually packed.

226
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:34,754
Min-woo, do you want to eat out?

227
00:13:34,838 --> 00:13:37,174
-You said you didn't want to.
-As you said,

228
00:13:37,257 --> 00:13:39,468
now that I'm smelling the ravioli,

229
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,470
I suddenly don't want it anymore.

230
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:43,054
Let's eat out.

231
00:13:43,638 --> 00:13:46,308
-Okay.
-Is Ms. Geum-hui busy nowadays?

232
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,144
What's wrong? Are you all right?

233
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:50,437
Yes, sir. I'm fine.

234
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:53,356
<i>So now you dare</i>

235
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:56,109
<i>to date someone else openly at work?</i>

236
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:58,904
Are you listening to me?

237
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:00,906
What are you looking at?

238
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:03,158
Why are you asking about Ms. Shin?

239
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:05,869
I just want to see her again.

240
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:08,205
It's fun being with her.

241
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:12,626
Tae-moo, set a date
and clear your schedule,

242
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:14,211
so we can all see each other.

243
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:18,256
Sure, I'll set something up
as soon as possible

244
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:22,761
What's wrong? Are you okay?

245
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:24,012
Yes, sir. I'm all right.

246
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:34,856
<i>What? You want me to attend
the Founding Anniversary Ceremony?</i>

247
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:36,775
Yes.

248
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:39,653
My grandfather wants us to meet together.

249
00:14:39,736 --> 00:14:41,696
And that's the only day I can make time.

250
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,535
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can attend that day.

251
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:49,788
Why? It's a Saturday,
so you don't have work, do you?

252
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,086
Well, that day just happens to be
my close friend's wedding.

253
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:57,879
-Show me the invitation.
-What?

254
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,131
I'll send them flowers
and congratulatory money

255
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:02,092
since you won't be able to go.

256
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,055
Oh, right!

257
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:11,560
Now I remember. The wedding is next week.

258
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,189
My family is holding
ancestral rites that day.

259
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:19,526
Isn't that usually done at night?
The ceremony will be done before then.

260
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:21,611
Actually…

261
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:27,742
Our company isn't doing so well right now.

262
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:32,080
What do you mean

263
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:33,957
it isn't doing well?

264
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:40,046
Our company is actually only a step away
from going bankrupt.

265
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:44,259
So all of the employees are working
overtime every day due to this emergency.

266
00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:49,472
So I think it'll be really hard for me to
attend the Founding Anniversary Ceremony.

267
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:56,187
Is that so?

268
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,772
Then there's no other choice.

269
00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:03,278
You'll have to pay the penalty fee.

270
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:09,242
The penalty fee?

271
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:16,583
What's this?

272
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:19,920
It's not much,
but use it to pay the penalty fee.

273
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,005
It's all I have.

274
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:33,475
It really isn't much.

275
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:35,977
This won't even make a dent.

276
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:37,812
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,106
But I don't have
a lot of money nowadays either.

278
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,442
It's really tough
to live on just your salary.

279
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:44,653
Rent, utility bills,
daily living expenses.

280
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:47,072
And why are maintenance fees so expensive?

281
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:51,743
You think I have time to listen
to a rich girl complain about her life?

282
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:53,787
What do I do?

283
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:57,666
If I go to the ceremony like this
and somebody recognizes me,

284
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:59,084
it's completely over for me.

285
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:04,756
Hey, calm down.

286
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,967
But how would they recognize you?

287
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,636
Geum-hui and Ha-ri
are two totally different people.

288
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:12,430
-I bet nobody will recognize you.
-Do you think so?

289
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:29,531
What? Her company's going bankrupt?

290
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:33,827
So now she's lying
about a company's bankruptcy?

291
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:35,912
My goodness.

292
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:41,042
Are you hungry? Should I order some food?

293
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,585
It's fine.

294
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:47,966
Why are there so many packages?

295
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:49,467
Just leave them.

296
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:52,220
CHA SUNG-HOON

JIN YOUNG-SEO

298
00:17:58,643 --> 00:17:59,477
Jin Young-Seo?

299
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:02,981
Stop!

300
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:08,319
Is this the Jin Young-seo that I know?

301
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:11,406
Well…

302
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:14,993
I missed the right time
to tell you about it.

303
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:18,747
But yes. The one who moved in next door,
Jin Young-seo.

304
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,169
Did we seriously
have to drink at your place?

305
00:18:24,252 --> 00:18:26,588
What if we run into Mr. Cha?

306
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,965
That's why we're taking the stairs.

307
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,134
There's no reason for you to be so scared.

308
00:18:31,217 --> 00:18:32,594
-Who are you?
-Ha-ri?

309
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:34,763
You're Shin Geum-hui.

310
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:38,725
He thinks that Geum-hui is my friend.
It's okay, let's go.

311
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:40,143
Really?

312
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:47,692
God, this is so stressful.

313
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,737
Should I just get him
a studio he can clean?

314
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:58,369
Mr. Cha?

315
00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:06,920
What are you doing here?

316
00:19:07,003 --> 00:19:09,297
Your packages were delivered to my unit.

317
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,050
What? Why would my packages
get delivered to your place?

318
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:14,260
Did the delivery man make a mistake?

319
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:16,221
No, you did. Look at the address!

320

00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:21,309
Put in the correct address next time.

323
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,977
Sorry.

324
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:32,237
Do you have a guest over?

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,571
-I'm almost--
-Do you want--

326
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:34,739
It's really delicious.

327
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:37,909
Didn't I tell you not to do this?
Don't cross the line!

328
00:19:40,453 --> 00:19:41,830
This is just ridiculous.

329
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:45,834
Everyone makes mistakes!
Why did he have to make such a big fuss?

330
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:49,212
I know. At work, people always say
that he's very polite and nice.

331
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:51,548
But he seemed totally different today.

332
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:55,885
I can't believe that I called
a guy who's that touchy and petty

333
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:57,762
"the man of my dreams."

334
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,889
You just watch.

335
00:20:00,473 --> 00:20:05,478
Mr. Cha, I'll draw all those lines
you want so badly.

336
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,899
You didn't mean it when you said
you'd bring Shin Geum…

337
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:14,988
I mean, Shin Ha-ri to the Founding
Anniversary Ceremony, right?

338
00:20:15,071 --> 00:20:17,157
I'm really going to bring her.

339
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,286
I feel bad for Ms. Shin.

340
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:23,371
What?

341
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:27,750
Do you really think that comment
is appropriate in this situation?

342
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:30,920
-Are you taking Ms. Shin's side right now?
-I'm not.

343
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:33,173
But you're the one who suggested it

344
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:35,175
when you knew she was
a stand-in for someone else.

345
00:20:35,258 --> 00:20:37,135
And you even made it sound like a threat.

346
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:41,264
Also, I'm sure she had to hide
that she worked for our company.

347
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:43,766
So I think this might be a bit much.

348
00:20:47,437 --> 00:20:49,981
So what are you saying?
That I'm in the wrong?

349
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:51,524
Well, that's not what I meant.

350
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:54,736
I'm just saying maybe
you can just forgive her now.

351
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:57,405
As an employee,
Ms. Shin doesn't have any issues.

352
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:58,406
She does.

353
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,366
She's good at her job--

354
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,284
Good at her job?

355
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,246
She had her crush of seven years
work for the company she works at.

356
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,372
Anyway!

357
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:10,126
She's dragging
all of her personal issues into her work.

358
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:15,965
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Well…

359
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:18,593
You just seem to lose your calm

360
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:21,221
when Ms. Shin is involved.

361
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:27,727
I guess nobody else
has made me so angry before.

362
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:34,567
Just watch. I'll make her take off

363
00:21:35,276 --> 00:21:38,363
that despicable mask
with her own hands and beg me for mercy.

364
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:47,997
I don't want to go to work.

365
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:52,794
What's this?

366
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:56,422
You just left it over there
so I set it up for you.

367
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:58,633
I thought you forgot about it
after buying it.

368
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:03,513
I didn't buy it. It was
from a guy who lives on the sixth floor.

369
00:22:03,596 --> 00:22:04,472
Really?

370
00:22:05,098 --> 00:22:06,724
Why didn't you unwrap it then?

371
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:08,726
He gave it to me for no reason,

372
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,645
and he was kind of hitting on me.

373
00:22:11,354 --> 00:22:14,774
I stole the hearts of all the men
in the neighborhood as soon as I moved in.

374
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:16,567
Still, isn't it pretty?

375
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:18,528
Yes, I guess so.

376
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,447
Good morning.

377
00:22:24,158 --> 00:22:25,702
I'm not having a good morning.

378
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:26,828
Pardon?

379
00:22:28,454 --> 00:22:31,833
Remember the Bucket List Fish
renewal report that you submitted?

380
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,876
Check it again.

381
00:22:34,377 --> 00:22:36,004
Apparently, it has an issue.

382
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:39,590
No way. I checked really thoroughly
before I submitted it.

383
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,344
Are you sure you checked thoroughly?

384
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,264
You didn't just rush through it
because of the ravioli?

385
00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:49,851
No! I pulled an all-nighter
double-checking it before I turned it in.

386
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:52,979
You work so hard,

387
00:22:53,062 --> 00:22:56,274
which is why a mere senior researcher
like you got the Mega Hit Award!

388
00:22:58,484 --> 00:22:59,318
What…

389
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:03,322
Ms. Shin, you were chosen
as the recipient of the Mega Hit Award.

390
00:23:03,406 --> 00:23:05,575
-Congratulations!
-Really?

391
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:07,410
Wait, Ms. Yeo, really?

392
00:23:07,493 --> 00:23:09,746
Yes. I heard it with my own ears.

393
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,839
Oh, my, that got me dizzy.

394
00:23:19,922 --> 00:23:21,466
I'm dizzy.

395
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:24,677
Lucky you, Ms. Shin.

396
00:23:24,761 --> 00:23:26,846
You'll get an award
from President Kang himself

397
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:29,057
at the Founding Anniversary Ceremony.

398
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,851
Right? I'll get an award
from President Kang himself

399
00:23:31,934 --> 00:23:33,644
at the Founding Anniversary Ceremony…

400
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:36,606
What?

401
00:23:36,689 --> 00:23:37,523
The award.

402
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:39,233
For you.

403
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:40,943
What?

404
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:50,036
Ms. Shin, are you that happy
about the award?

405
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,454
Of course, she's happy.

406
00:23:52,205 --> 00:23:54,040
Laugh all you want, Ms. Shin!

407
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:01,964
How is this situation real?

408
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,342
40TH ANNIVERSARY OF
THE FOUNDING OF GO FOOD

409
00:24:07,261 --> 00:24:10,640
So I'll go to the Founding Anniversary
Ceremony with Mr. Kang…

410
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,978
Yes! I did it!

411
00:24:17,313 --> 00:24:20,149
…and get an award from Mr. Kang too.

412
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:23,402
Sung-hoon, you should move
and start looking for your other half too.

413
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:25,696
I need to stop giving work to Mr. Cha.

414
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,199
-Where's Ms. Shin?
-Where did Ms. Geum-hui go?

415
00:24:32,453 --> 00:24:34,914
I have to be in one place as two people!

416
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:39,127
Catching two birds with one stone!

417
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:42,046
Maybe that doesn't apply.

418
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:46,134
What am I supposed to do?

419
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:51,722
Okay, there's only one solution.

420
00:24:53,182 --> 00:24:56,144
I have to attend as Geum-hui
because of the penalty fee,

421
00:24:57,603 --> 00:24:59,981
so the employee Shin Ha-ri
won't be able to go.

422
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:05,319
HOW TO GET OUT OF WORK EVENTS

423
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:06,362
GUIDELINE FOR OFFICE WORKERS

424
00:25:06,445 --> 00:25:07,613
<i>Step one.</i>

425
00:25:07,697 --> 00:25:11,534
<i>Subtly buildup my excuse in advance
so they'll believe that I can't go.</i>

426
00:25:11,617 --> 00:25:13,744
Gosh. Are you getting a cold?

427
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:14,954
<i>Step two.</i>

428
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:18,791
<i>Be persistent with the plan
that I've started.</i>

429
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:22,128
Oh, I don't really have an appetite.
You all should go without me.

430
00:25:22,211 --> 00:25:26,257
<i>Lastly, if I show them that I really
want to attend the event,</i>

431
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,301
<i>nobody will suspect me.</i>

432
00:25:28,384 --> 00:25:29,927
<i>It has to work!</i>

433
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,182
Well, then. I should get going.

434
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:53,534
-Did you do as I said?
-<i>Yes, sir.</i>

435
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:56,954
No matter hard she tries,
she won't be able to escape the trap

436
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:59,165
that I've set up for her.

437
00:25:59,248 --> 00:26:01,751
Whether it's Shin Geum-hui or Shin Ha-ri.

438
00:26:06,923 --> 00:26:10,009
Flowers never get old. It's so pretty.

439
00:26:10,092 --> 00:26:12,011
-Honey, read it, quick!
-Okay.

440
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:14,055
"Hello."

441
00:26:14,764 --> 00:26:17,516
"Your daughter,
Senior Researcher Shin Ha-ri,

442
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,144
has been chosen as the recipient of
the Mega Hit Award."

443
00:26:20,686 --> 00:26:21,938
What's the Mega Hit Award?

444
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:24,565
It means she made
a product that was a huge hit.

445
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,652
Like the Bucket List Fish!
That one was pretty popular.

446
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:29,153
Right.

447
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:30,071
Quickly.

448
00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:33,032
-Then what?
-"Ms. Shin's family is invited

449
00:26:33,115 --> 00:26:34,951
-to this honorable event
-Go on.

450
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:36,535
-and we would love…
<i>-Come on.</i>

451
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:38,913
<i>They never invited
our family members before this.</i>

452
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:41,165
<i>Why are they suddenly doing this?</i>

453
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:43,167
He called us distinguished guests!

454
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:51,425
So many people are here.

455
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,511
Is Ms. Shin still not here?

456
00:26:53,594 --> 00:26:55,388
-I haven't seen her.
-Me neither.

457
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:56,472
There's Chairman Kang.

458
00:26:56,555 --> 00:26:59,183
Ms. Geum-hui, do you like to fish?

459
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:01,310
Well, yes. Because my parents like it.

460
00:27:01,394 --> 00:27:04,730
Really? You like fishing?

461
00:27:04,814 --> 00:27:05,773
I guess so.

462
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:12,280
-The award ceremony is starting soon, sir.
-All right.

463
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:19,912
Let's see, where's our Ha-ri?

464
00:27:19,996 --> 00:27:21,247
Excuse me.

465
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,791
-Do you mind if I use the toilet?
-Go ahead.

466
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:41,225
-Oh, my.
-Oh, my.

467
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:42,852
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

468
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:44,395
Wait a minute!

469
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,024
Are you

470
00:27:48,524 --> 00:27:49,608
perhaps…

471
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:51,319
Ha-ri?

472
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:52,486
Ha-ri?

473
00:27:53,195 --> 00:27:54,572
You're Ha-ri, right?

474
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:56,115
Ha-ri.

475
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:00,661
Ha-ri? Ha-ri.

476
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:01,746
No, that's not me.

477
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:04,081
Ha-ri, why do you look like this?

478
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:06,792
You're Shin Ha-ri, right?

479
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:10,921
Shin Ha-ri!

480
00:28:14,717 --> 00:28:16,510
I'm not Ha-ri.

481
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:17,845
Come here!

482
00:28:19,513 --> 00:28:20,473
What?

483
00:28:33,486 --> 00:28:34,654
Shin Geum-hui is actually

484
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,281
Shin Ha-ri?

485
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:40,951
Get this woman out of here, now!

486
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:44,955
I'm a victim, too!

487
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:49,335
How could I have known
that the president of my company

488
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:51,295
would show up to that blind date?

489
00:28:53,464 --> 00:28:54,674
No!

490
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:59,679
But don't you smell
something burning somewhere?

491
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:05,893
I'm sorry.

492
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,192
I'm sorry, sorry…

493
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,365
Ms. Shin.

494
00:29:21,117 --> 00:29:22,076
Ms. Shin.

495
00:29:22,743 --> 00:29:23,744
Ms. Shin.

496
00:29:31,252 --> 00:29:32,795
-Hello, sir.
-Did you have a good nap?

497
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:34,046
Well, I…

498
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,424
-Where's the ravioli for me to try today?
-Here.

499
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:38,384
It's hot!

500
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:40,177
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

501
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:42,388
Be careful.

502
00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:45,641
When did this get so burnt?

503
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,768
Do it again.

504
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,080
Do you smell something burning…

505
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:12,209
If she knows she's done wrong,
she should just tell me the truth and beg!

506
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:15,463
It's hot!

507
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:17,173
-Are you okay?
-It's hot.

508
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,674
Be careful.

509
00:30:20,342 --> 00:30:23,053
How could an experienced researcher
be so careless?

510
00:30:24,764 --> 00:30:25,639
Wait.

511
00:30:26,265 --> 00:30:28,642
Why am I worried about that woman?

512
00:30:31,353 --> 00:30:34,732
<i>Look at him. It's because he likes her.</i>

513
00:30:35,858 --> 00:30:37,067
<i>BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI</i>

514
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,987
You call this a report?

515
00:30:40,654 --> 00:30:42,448
Do it again. Again!

516
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:45,701
<i>Yes, sir. I'm sorry.</i>

517
00:30:46,368 --> 00:30:48,245
He's so petty.

518
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:51,332
Messing with Geum-hui for no reason.

519
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,464
SPARKLING MANGO BUBBLES

520
00:30:58,547 --> 00:30:59,465
Wait, that's…

521
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,426
That's Chairman Park's product.

522
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:05,221
Red mango flavor.

523
00:31:05,304 --> 00:31:06,180
<i>Red mango.</i>

524
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:08,224
Shin Geum-hui.

525
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:10,601
They're so alike.

526
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:14,897
Is it a new product?

527
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:17,942
It does look good.

528
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:19,485
Damn it.

529
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:22,446
They should have used our product.

530
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:28,285
This should be delicious.

531
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:34,375
This place is really popular
in the neighborhood.

532
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:36,085
Today's finally the day!

533
00:31:36,168 --> 00:31:38,754
-Did anybody come alone?
-Me!

534
00:31:38,838 --> 00:31:40,464
-You can come in first.
-Really?

535
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,926
Excuse me.

536
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:49,265
You can sit next to the man over there
who also came alone.

537
00:31:49,348 --> 00:31:50,808
-Sure.
-Excuse me.

538
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,403
<i>No.</i>

539
00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:06,740
<i>I waited in line to have food here. Yes.</i>

540
00:32:10,703 --> 00:32:11,620
<i>There's the header!</i>

541
00:32:11,704 --> 00:32:13,747
<i>The goalkeeper blocked it.</i>

542
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:16,834
-Excuse me.
-<i>The ball hasn't cleared far.</i>

543
00:32:17,793 --> 00:32:20,087
I'm sorry I keep running into you.

544
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:24,675
But I don't think I can help it
since we live in the same neighborhood.

545
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:26,510
And we can't keep avoiding each other.

546
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:28,053
Yes, that's fine with me too.

547
00:32:28,137 --> 00:32:29,013
Please eat.

548
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:32,892
I'll be careful to not cross the line
as neighbors, though.

549
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:50,200
It's fine as long as
we don't cross this line, right?

550
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:54,538
Excuse me.

551
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,540
Be careful, it's hot.

552
00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:57,833
Thank you.

553
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,714
I finally get to eat this.

554
00:33:08,969 --> 00:33:10,930
Oh, I'm sorry.

555
00:33:12,181 --> 00:33:13,057
What?

556
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:16,727
The steam from my food
went over the line onto your side.

557
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:17,770
Sorry.

558
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,730
Come back here.

559
00:33:28,197 --> 00:33:29,531
Here's your drink.

560
00:33:29,615 --> 00:33:30,866
Thank you.

561
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,203
The bottle opener is over there.

562
00:33:34,828 --> 00:33:38,624
I'm sorry, but I can't cross the line
over to his side.

563
00:33:38,707 --> 00:33:40,960
-Could you get it for me, please?
-The line?

564
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:42,294
It's all right.

565
00:33:44,004 --> 00:33:45,214
Go ahead, use it.

566
00:33:46,465 --> 00:33:47,758
No.

567
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:50,928
We promised to not cross the line.

568
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,264
I got it.

569
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,698
-Don't you have to flip these over?
-Thank you.

570
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:12,074
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

571
00:34:12,157 --> 00:34:14,368
They always put this in front of me.

572
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:19,373
I really like these spicy marinated crabs.

573
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:21,333
These are the reason why I come here.

574
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:24,044
But isn't it so fishy?
Just eat it all by yourself.

575
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,962
Sure.

576
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:27,756
Mr. Gye, you must really hate
marinated crabs.

577
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,591
You always give them to Ms. Yeo.

578
00:34:31,176 --> 00:34:36,056
So, now we have two people on our team
who received the Mega Hit Award.

579
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,224
Here.

580
00:34:37,725 --> 00:34:40,561
Let's say cheers with just
the Mega Hit Award recipients, shall we?

581
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:43,313
Thank you.

582
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:53,198
Did you not receive one, Mr. Gye?

583
00:34:53,282 --> 00:34:54,158
-Yes.
-Yes.

584
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:56,243
If he did, he would've been promoted.

585
00:34:56,326 --> 00:34:58,120
Most of our peers are department heads.

586
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:00,414
Really?

587
00:35:00,497 --> 00:35:03,208
Finally, the mystery is solved!

588
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,004
I really didn't know.

589
00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:12,342
-One more bottle here, please.
-Sure.

590
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:15,679
Aren't you drinking
too much today, Ms. Shin?

591
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,976
You can get a bit drunk
on days like these.

592
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,270
Thank you.

593
00:35:24,104 --> 00:35:25,397
Ms. Shin?

594
00:35:25,481 --> 00:35:28,567
You've been working
very hard recently, right?

595
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:31,612
But that's over now.

596
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:32,821
Really?

597
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:36,909
I think it's just starting.

598
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:44,750
Since you got the award, you've basically
gotten an express ticket to a promotion.

599
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:47,628
Can't you tell by looking at me?

600
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,424
Of course. I know very well.

601
00:35:52,508 --> 00:35:57,513
You also got an express ticket to becoming
an unmarried old woman, right?

602
00:35:58,764 --> 00:35:59,973
Damn it.

603
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:03,393
Mr. Gye, why did you get
an express ticket to becoming

604
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:06,939
an unmarried old man
when you never even got an award?

605
00:36:09,024 --> 00:36:10,150
Is it just me?

606
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:13,695
Ms. Kim has been coming after me tonight.

607
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:15,155
What?

608
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,118
It's all because she takes after you.

609
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:21,703
Why are you being so petty?

610
00:36:21,787 --> 00:36:24,623
Do you have to be so jealous
about Ha-ri getting an award?

611
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:28,168
Jealous? Who's being jealous?

612
00:36:29,586 --> 00:36:32,631
That Mega Hit Award,
it's not even a really big award.

613
00:36:32,714 --> 00:36:33,799
Right.

614
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:36,218
It's not

615
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:38,512
a big award.

616
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:40,305
It is a big award.

617
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:43,308
Even Mr. Gye has never gotten it.

618
00:36:44,184 --> 00:36:45,644
Right?

619
00:36:47,896 --> 00:36:51,483
I don't think I can eat anymore.
I'm already full from Ms. Kim's insults.

620
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:54,069
You're giving me too much.

621
00:36:54,153 --> 00:36:55,028
Fine!

622
00:36:55,654 --> 00:36:57,656
I've never gotten the Mega Hit Award.

623
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:00,617
So I'm dying of jealousy
because of Ms. Shin. Happy now?

624
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:02,953
Did I do something?

625
00:37:03,036 --> 00:37:07,124
Then, Mr. Gye,

626
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:09,585
do you want to receive the award
instead of me?

627
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:15,174
I just really don't want it.

628
00:37:15,924 --> 00:37:17,968
I'll give it to you instead.

629
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:21,805
You can accept it instead of me, Mr. Gye!

630
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:30,105
I can deal with Ms. Yeo
insulting me to my face,

631
00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:33,483
and Ms. Kim insulting me
in a more roundabout way,

632
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:37,529
but I really can't handle
Ms. Shin attacking me like that.

633
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:40,866
All of you are so mean!

634
00:37:41,867 --> 00:37:43,160
Are you crying?

635
00:37:43,243 --> 00:37:44,244
Yes!

636
00:37:45,245 --> 00:37:46,914
Don't cry.

637
00:37:48,123 --> 00:37:52,377
-It's making me sad, too.
-Why are you doing that?

638
00:37:52,461 --> 00:37:55,047
-My jaw's dislocated.
-Don't cry on a day like this.

639
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,216
My jaw, my jaw hurts.

640
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:58,759
-Stop crying!
-Don't cry.

641
00:37:58,842 --> 00:37:59,801
Stop it!

642
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:01,637
Ms. Shin, don't cry!

643
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,167
What is it at this hour?

644
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,752
SHIN GEUM-HUI

645
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,797
Hello.

646
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,758
<i>Mr. Kang.</i>

647
00:38:19,841 --> 00:38:23,470
<i>How much is the penalty fee?</i>

648
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:25,638
You know,

649
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:30,560
I really don't think that I can attend

650
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:33,438
the Founding Anniversary Ceremony.

651
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:34,898
But…

652
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:38,526
about the penalty fee…

653
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,112
I really don't have the means

654
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,656
to pay for it.

655
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:46,743
It sounds like you're drunk.
Let's talk later.

656
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:49,204
I'm not drunk.

657
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:52,791
I…

658
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:57,378
I really have a good reason why…

659
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:01,091
<i>Hey, you!</i>

660
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:02,258
"Hey, you"?

661
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:04,594
Did you just say that to me?

662
00:39:04,677 --> 00:39:05,887
No, not you.

663
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:10,100
There are some high schoolers over there
smoking in this neighborhood.

664
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:11,976
One second.

665
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:15,105
Hey!

666
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:18,566
You can't smoke over there.
You're even wearing your school uniforms.

667
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,318
Put it out, quickly.

668
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:24,030
Come on. Put it out.

669
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:28,243
Don't throw… Hey!

670
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:30,370
Why did you throw away the butts there?

671
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:33,039
Aren't you going to pick it up?
Come back and pick it up.

672
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:36,376
Hey, I said, pick it up…

673
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,253
Hello? What…

674
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:39,671
Hello?

675
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,430
<i>The person you have called is unavailable.</i>

676
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:12,203
Excuse me.

677
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:14,914
-She's about this tall, and her hair--
-We haven't.

678
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:46,029
Excuse me.

679
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:49,657
Sorry.

680
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,667
Where is she?

681
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:06,424
Ms. Shin.

682
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,093
Ms. Shin.

683
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,638
Ms. Shin…

684
00:41:17,685 --> 00:41:18,686
Ms. Shin.

685
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:22,315
Ms. Shin, wake up. Are you all right?

686
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:24,067
Ms. Shin!

687
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,444
What?

688
00:41:27,028 --> 00:41:28,321
Mr. Kang.

689
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:32,492
What?

690
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,371
How did you know to come all the way here?

691
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:45,004
Are you the real Kang Tae-moo?

692
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,011
Just how much have you had to drink?

693
00:41:55,473 --> 00:41:58,101
Just a bit.

694
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,440
Snap out of it. You need to go home.

695
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:07,568
It's cold.

696
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:13,449
By the way, Mr. Kang.

697
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:15,785
This…

698
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,538
is a dream, right?

699
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:21,666
What?

700
00:42:24,377 --> 00:42:26,462
If this isn't a dream…

701
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:32,593
there's no way you would
come running to take care of me…

702
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:36,973
like this.

703
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:40,935
That's right.

704
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:51,112
Since this is a dream,

705
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:55,116
can I tell you a secret?

706
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:02,206
What is it?

707
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,506
I'm…

708
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:14,635
Shin Ha-ri.

709
00:43:18,306 --> 00:43:20,224
Shin Ha-ri

710
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:24,062
is Shin Geum-hui.

711
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:29,025
It feels so good to let it out.

712
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,905
I'm sorry for everything.

713
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:39,285
Sorry.

714
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:55,885
Shin Ha-ri!

715
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:58,054
Hey, where are you?

716
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:06,104
Look at you! Why are you sleeping here?

717
00:44:06,187 --> 00:44:08,147
Damn it, why are you hitting me?

718
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:10,149
Hey, get up, quick. Let's go home.

719
00:44:10,942 --> 00:44:12,068
Let's go.

720
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:15,279
-Look at you.
-When did you get here?

721
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:17,365
I've been looking for you all this time.

722
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:39,137
If this isn't a dream…

723
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:45,476
there's no way you would
come running to take care of me…

724
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:49,397
like this.

725
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:52,525
<i>You just seem to lose your calm</i>

726
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:54,735
when Ms. Shin is involved.

727
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:00,533
It makes no sense.

728
00:45:01,659 --> 00:45:03,161
I'm treating something fake

729
00:45:03,995 --> 00:45:05,413
as if it's real.

730
00:45:17,842 --> 00:45:19,802
Get up, Ha-ri.

731
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:24,682
Come on, get up!
You're going to be late again.

732
00:45:24,765 --> 00:45:26,851
Stop it.

733
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:31,397
How did I get home yesterday?

734
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,858
Gosh, look at you. Don't you remember?

735
00:45:34,692 --> 00:45:38,571
You were sleeping at the playground.
Ha-min carried you back home.

736
00:45:38,654 --> 00:45:40,615
Why are you going around drinking so much?

737
00:45:40,698 --> 00:45:42,783
My team…

738
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:46,871
My team wanted
to congratulate me on my award.

739
00:45:46,954 --> 00:45:50,458
The next time you get an award,
you might actually die.

740
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:52,460
Snap out of it, and come eat breakfast.

741
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:55,463
You need to go to work. Come out.

742
00:45:55,546 --> 00:45:56,464
Okay.

743
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:02,762
I remember

744
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:06,766
getting into a taxi to go home last night.

745
00:46:17,777 --> 00:46:20,863
<i>Did you get home okay?
Reply when you see this text.</i>

746
00:46:20,947 --> 00:46:22,323
<i>Did you get home okay?</i>

747
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:26,118
Mr. Kang also sent me a text.
What did he say?

748
00:46:34,627 --> 00:46:35,461
Hello.

749
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:40,299
What did you mean by your text?
I'm having a hard time understanding it.

750
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,801
I meant exactly what I said.

751
00:46:41,884 --> 00:46:44,095
As of today, you're fired,
Ms. Shin Geum-hui.

752
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:49,767
I mean, what exactly
do you mean by "fired"?

753
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:53,896
It means that we'll never
have to see each other again.

754
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:55,731
I'm hanging up now.

755
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,861
Wait, hello?

756
00:47:04,156 --> 00:47:05,366
Just like that?

757
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:09,161
Wait.

758
00:47:10,288 --> 00:47:11,247
Then…

759
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:14,333
that means that I don't have to

760
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:16,377
worry so much anymore.

761
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:25,094
Did you dye your hair?

762
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:28,806
Good morning!

763
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:29,765
Yes.

764
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,767
Not a good morning.

765
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:33,185
It's not good at all for me.

766
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:35,938
What? Why? Did something bad happen?

767
00:47:36,022 --> 00:47:36,856
What?

768
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:39,817
Don't you remember
what you said to me yesterday?

769
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,819
That's not important right now.

770
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:46,073
Ms. Shin, you don't have to keep working
on the ravioli anymore.

771
00:47:46,157 --> 00:47:47,742
What? Why?

772
00:47:47,825 --> 00:47:50,244
-They're going with the original version.
-What?

773
00:47:50,328 --> 00:47:52,079
I heard it from Mr. Cha.

774
00:47:52,163 --> 00:47:54,999
I don't know why
but President Kang said so.

775
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:58,085
He put her through hell only to say that?

776
00:47:58,169 --> 00:48:01,547
Well, all of that work just proves
the ravioli I made the first time

777
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:02,965
was the best, right?

778
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:04,633
It's all right.

779
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:13,059
She was depressed yesterday,
and today she's happy?

780
00:48:14,894 --> 00:48:15,936
She's gone crazy.

781
00:48:16,604 --> 00:48:19,523
She was put through the mill
just to end up like that.

782
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:27,782
Sir.

783
00:48:28,366 --> 00:48:30,910
Have you decided to forgive Ms. Shin?

784
00:48:31,994 --> 00:48:33,245
Yes.

785
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:36,290
I realized that I was investing
too much time into something

786
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:38,000
that's insignificant.

787
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:40,127
But why a business trip all of a sudden?

788
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:42,254
<i>There's no way
I have feelings for Shin Ha-ri.</i>

789
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:46,425
<i>My brain's just confused
because I saw her so often recently.</i>

790
00:48:47,176 --> 00:48:50,096
<i>This will pass
if I don't see her for a few days.</i>

791
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:53,599
NEW YORK

792
00:48:55,893 --> 00:48:59,105
About the packaging, is there a reason
why you're so set on it?

793
00:48:59,897 --> 00:49:03,734
We would like to use our own packaging
because it has our brand logo on it.

794
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:04,735
As you can see,

795
00:49:05,486 --> 00:49:06,904
it's not ordinary packaging.

796
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,282
We designed it
as traditional Korean pots.

797
00:49:10,366 --> 00:49:14,203
And also, it's a scientific re-creation
of valves and filters

798
00:49:14,286 --> 00:49:17,998
in order to really boost
the Kimchi fermentation results.

799
00:49:18,874 --> 00:49:21,293
This is what differentiates us
from other companies.

800
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:28,300
This cannot be negotiable.
If you say no, there's no deal.

801
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,351
There's no need for that.

802
00:49:42,648 --> 00:49:43,941
Thank you for your trust in our company.

803
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:46,444
Not at all. We became
a huge fan of your company.

804
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:47,361
Really?

805
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:49,905
Would it be okay to ask
what made you such a fan?

806
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,703
What made you like me so much, Mr. Kang?

807
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:00,833
Sorry about that.

808
00:50:03,711 --> 00:50:05,045
What are you sorry about?

809
00:50:06,964 --> 00:50:08,466
Are you sorry for being so petty

810
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:11,051
and messing with me
because it hurt your pride

811
00:50:11,135 --> 00:50:12,928
when I'm not even interested in you?

812
00:50:23,606 --> 00:50:26,484
It's my first time watching
the fireworks at Han River!

813
00:50:29,987 --> 00:50:31,947
<i>Just admit it already.</i>

814
00:50:35,826 --> 00:50:38,037
You didn't want
to admit your feelings for me,

815
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,622
so you came this far.

816
00:50:40,331 --> 00:50:41,874
But you kept thinking of me.

817
00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:43,876
Right?

818
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,377
Right?

819
00:51:03,813 --> 00:51:05,982
I thought we'd finally
get to see your president

820
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,859
who's supposed to be so good-looking.

821
00:51:07,942 --> 00:51:09,444
But we didn't even get a glimpse.

822
00:51:09,527 --> 00:51:11,237
Well, he's so busy.

823
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:14,949
Ms. Han, so what if he's handsome?
He has a rotten personality.

824
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:18,119
-What?
-He bullied her into remaking the ravioli.

825
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:19,329
I see.

826
00:51:19,412 --> 00:51:21,956
-But besides that, may I eat first?
-Go ahead.

827
00:51:27,712 --> 00:51:28,838
-Why?
-What is this?

828
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:30,965
Right. This is a bit spicy for you, right?

829
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:32,384
It is spicy,

830
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:35,470
but it's sweet and savory too.
I really like it.

831
00:51:35,553 --> 00:51:36,805
Right?

832
00:51:36,888 --> 00:51:38,556
It's addictive.

833
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,267
You'll keep thinking about it
once you've had it.

834
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:44,104
I'm going to take the award upstairs.

835
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:02,038
Very pretty.

836
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:09,587
I thought I would be relieved.

837
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:21,808
Ms. Shin, somebody keeps calling you.

838
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:23,268
You're right.

839
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,019
I don't know this number.

840
00:52:27,897 --> 00:52:28,731
Hello?

841
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:31,317
<i>This is Ms. Shin Geum-hui's phone, right?</i>

842
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:32,569
Yes, this is Shin Geum…

843
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:34,571
hui?

844
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:37,490
Wait, who is this?

845
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:41,744
I'm Tae-moo's grandfather.

846
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:42,704
What?

847
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:47,083
How did you get my number?

848
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,507
<i>It's been a while since I saw you,
so let's have dinner together.</i>

849
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:58,178
<i>I'll send you the address,
so meet me there.</i>

850
00:52:58,261 --> 00:52:59,888
<i>Okay?</i>

851
00:52:59,971 --> 00:53:01,014
Let's go home now.

852
00:53:01,514 --> 00:53:03,183
-Yes, let's all go home.
-Okay.

853
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,019
Good work, everyone.

854
00:53:06,102 --> 00:53:07,604
-Yes.
-Have a nice night!

855
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:09,147
I really did a lot of good work.

856
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:11,900
-It's only right that we go home.
-Bye, everyone.

857
00:53:11,983 --> 00:53:13,151
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 1

858
00:53:16,654 --> 00:53:19,115
<i>Didn't he take care of things at home
when he fired me?</i>

859
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:21,493
<i>It's not like I can just ignore this.</i>

860
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:23,536
<i>Damn it.</i>

861
00:53:31,544 --> 00:53:33,087
SHIN HA-RI

862
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:48,603
CHAIRMAN

863
00:53:53,191 --> 00:53:54,567
Hello?

864
00:54:03,618 --> 00:54:07,413
<i>Go buy us drinks. Your treat.</i>

865
00:54:07,497 --> 00:54:08,373
Wait.

866
00:54:08,873 --> 00:54:11,834
Didn't he say that he'd go
on a business trip with Kang Tae-moo?

867
00:54:19,634 --> 00:54:21,469
I don't think he's home.

868
00:54:23,054 --> 00:54:24,597
Will he not be back tonight?

869
00:54:29,727 --> 00:54:30,937
Young-seo.

870
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,606
You're crossing the line again.

871
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,608
Let's not cross the line. Let's not…

872
00:54:37,068 --> 00:54:37,986
Oh, no!

873
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:42,323
Did it break?

874
00:54:42,907 --> 00:54:44,367
It did.

875
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:47,870
This is so annoying.

876
00:54:54,168 --> 00:54:55,086
What is this?

877
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:00,967
What's this?

878
00:55:05,638 --> 00:55:07,390
This is actually
something I designed myself.

879
00:55:07,473 --> 00:55:10,435
It's better to put it in the bedroom
instead of the living room.

880
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:20,862
Yes, I have the evidence.
I'm going to the police station now.

881
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:22,614
Young-seo.

882
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:28,161
Where are you going?
I've been calling after you.

883
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:29,787
Were you?

884
00:55:30,496 --> 00:55:31,914
I must not have heard.

885
00:55:43,718 --> 00:55:44,636
I see.

886
00:55:45,887 --> 00:55:47,096
Are you all right?

887
00:55:49,724 --> 00:55:50,933
Why do you have the lamp?

888
00:55:52,727 --> 00:55:55,146
It broke because I dropped it.

889
00:55:55,229 --> 00:55:56,731
I'm going to fix it. Give it here.

890
00:55:59,692 --> 00:56:01,069
I'll fix it for you.

891
00:56:02,111 --> 00:56:04,489
It's okay, I'll do it. Give it back.

892
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:07,617
-Let go of it.
-Damn it, I said I'll fix it!

893
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,827
-It's fine! What are you doing?
-Let go of it.

894
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:11,579
What are you doing?

895
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,124
It looks like
that belongs to Ms. Jin, so why…

896
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,879
Ms. Jin, are you all right?

897
00:56:19,962 --> 00:56:21,255
Help me.

898
00:56:21,339 --> 00:56:25,009
He secretly filmed videos of me!
Please catch him!

899
00:56:25,093 --> 00:56:26,010
Quick!

900
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:36,979
Stop right there!

901
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:18,271
What are you doing? Damn it!

902
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:30,992
Grandpa wants to have dinner,
so come if you can.

903
00:57:31,075 --> 00:57:32,702
-Why did you beat him up?
-I didn't!

904
00:57:32,785 --> 00:57:34,245
Just follow us, okay?

905
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:36,372
I don't think I can.

906
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:37,832
Where are you? It's so noisy.

907
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:40,460
I'm at the police station.

908
00:57:40,543 --> 00:57:41,794
Why the police station?

909
00:57:43,087 --> 00:57:44,422
What?

910
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:01,105
What are you doing here?

911
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:02,690
Your grandfather asked for me.

912
00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:06,778
I know I was fired,
but I couldn't just ignore him, so…

913
00:58:06,861 --> 00:58:08,946
-Didn't your friend call you?
-My friend?

914
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:11,449
-I mean Ms. Jin Young-seo.
-What about Young-seo?

915
00:58:13,534 --> 00:58:15,078
Let's go, Ms. Shin Ha-ri.

916
00:58:17,205 --> 00:58:18,039
Wait.

917
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:20,374
What?

918
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:22,043
What are you doing?

919
00:58:22,126 --> 00:58:23,419
Let's go, Ms. Shin Ha-ri.

920
00:58:24,754 --> 00:58:27,882
What did you just call me?

921
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,926
<i>You messed with someone
you should've never messed with.</i>

922
00:59:12,426 --> 00:59:15,054
<i>To confess your feelings
without the proper buildup….</i>

923
00:59:15,138 --> 00:59:17,723
<i>All the things you did to me
since you found out that I'm Shin Geum-hui</i>

924
00:59:17,807 --> 00:59:19,892
was to fire me, right?

925
00:59:20,434 --> 00:59:22,228
What I'm saying is…

926
00:59:22,311 --> 00:59:23,229
Why haven't you gone inside yet?

927
00:59:24,272 --> 00:59:27,108
Do you want to start seeing each other
with marriage in mind?

928
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:28,413
