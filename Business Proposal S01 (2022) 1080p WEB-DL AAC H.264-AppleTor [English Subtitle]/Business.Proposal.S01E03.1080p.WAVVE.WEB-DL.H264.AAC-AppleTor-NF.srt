00:00:00,064 --> 00:00:04,832
BUSINESS PROPOSAL

2
00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:07,888
EPISODE 3

3
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:19,845
Sorry.

4
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:30,981
-What are you doing here?
-Dad.

5
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:31,899
"Dad"?

6
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:34,652
-Running an errand for mom.
-Really? Let's go inside.

7
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:39,490
It's cold. Let's go in.

8
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:41,325
They're gone.

9
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,495
Mr. Kang. Get up, Mr.--

10
00:00:45,454 --> 00:00:46,580
Come on. Mr. Kang!

11
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:48,207
Mr. Kang!

12
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,291
Mr. Kang!

13
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,709
Mr. Kang.

14
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:56,548
This contract between "A" and "B"
aims to set the terms

15
00:00:56,632 --> 00:00:59,802
of the simulated romantic relationship
between both parties

16
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:02,680
and the requested meetings
with the grandfather of "A".

17
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,101
In the case of a breach of contract,

18
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:10,688
the penalty shall be 100 times
the contract amount… 100 times?

19
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,898
But that's just ridiculous!

20
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:15,484
I was so dizzy
that I had to clear my entire schedule.

21
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:18,737
I lost an important contract.
Do you know how much that cost me?

22
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:20,447
Still, this isn't right!

23
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:23,993
Someone ordered a chicken from
your place, but you failed to deliver it.

24
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:26,578
-What would happen to its reputation?
-That's…

25
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:28,998
I'll just make it up--

26
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:31,041
There's no "next time" in this world.

27
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,711
You've lost trust.
You can't put a price on that.

28
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:36,797
But still, this isn't right.

29
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,257
Just accept my offer.

30
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,010
Then I won't sue for damages,

31
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:43,637
and I'll still pay you what I promised.

32
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:50,019
Mr. Cha? Contact legal and tell them
to proceed with the lawsuit right away.

33
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:52,563
No, I'll do it! Fine.

34
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,774
You're very impatient.

35
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,082
I've summarized
some things you need to know

36
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,584
to carry out this contract.

37
00:02:14,793 --> 00:02:17,004
You need to memorize these things.

38
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,757
"Born in 1993, blood type B."

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,135
"Went to Hyunil private school
from elementary to high school."

40
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:25,262
"After graduating early, he was
admitted to Harvard at the age of 18."

41
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,889
At the age of 18?

42
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,475
BORN IN 1993
BLOOD TYPE B

43
00:02:29,558 --> 00:02:31,852
"<i>He graduated summa cum laude
from Harvard…</i>"

44
00:02:32,603 --> 00:02:34,897
"Thomas…"

45
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:37,024
How do you read that?

46
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:39,568
Thomas Hoopes Prize
for the Best Graduation Paper.

47
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,195
-What?
-It's a thing.

48
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,572
Oh, okay.

49
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:46,867
<i>Wow, you were a track and field
athlete in college?</i>

50
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:51,455
<i>Wow, you got good grades and
were an athlete too? That's impressive.</i>

51
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,249
My only flaw is that there's nothing
I'm not good at.

52
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,711
<i>All the projects I've headed
at the company were all successful too.</i>

53
00:02:57,795 --> 00:03:00,422
A JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF THE
NEWEST FREEZER TECHNOLOGY

54
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:02,925
I see.

55
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:06,470
What's that?

56
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,473
"<i>Fell in love while studying abroad
in New York.</i>"

57
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,891
-New York?
-Yes.

58
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:13,852
Since Mr. Kang has been in New York
for the past two years,

59
00:03:13,936 --> 00:03:15,687
this backstory seems the most natural.

60
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:17,564
But I didn't study in New York.

61
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:20,943
To address that, we've put together
a backstory for you too.

62
00:03:24,696 --> 00:03:27,574
DAD: TYPICAL LAWYER, MOM: TYPICAL DOCTOR,
HA-MIN: TYPICAL MED STUDENT

63
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:29,952
Typical?

64
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:32,746
This is a typical family?

65
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,875
Your family needs to seem
acceptable to Chairman Kang, so…

66
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:42,965
<i>He'd faint if I told him
that my family runs a local chicken shop.</i>

67
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:46,718
Anyway, the meeting with the chairman
is next Sunday.

68
00:03:46,802 --> 00:03:49,805
Be sure to memorize the backstory
we've put together for you by then.

69
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,931
Okay.

70
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,311
I won't tolerate any mistakes,
do you understand?

71
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,109
SHIN GEUM-HUI

72
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,821
Shin Geum-hui,
you went to a really good school.

73
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:07,156
Why are you watching this?

74
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,615
Leave it.

75
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,450
<i>Why can't you do anything by yourself?</i>

76
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:11,660
I told you to leave it…

77
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:14,538
<i>And if you're poor,
you should know your place in society.</i>

78
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,747
<i>The framework of this…</i>

79
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:23,922
Graduated from Hyunil elementary, middle,
and high school. Went to Harvard, and…

80
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,593
TOP 20 GLOBAL LEADERS
SELECTED BY <i>TIMES</i> MAGAZINE

81
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:30,137
Geum-hui, you sure snagged yourself
a pretty impressive boyfriend.

82
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:33,307
<i>-Geum-hui. Shin Geum-hui!</i>
-Yeah?

83
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:34,933
<i>Oh, Dad?</i>

84
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:36,643
<i>What are you daydreaming about?</i>

85
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:41,356
Wow, you're getting really immersed
in your new identity, Ms. Shin Geum-hui.

86
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:46,320
Is this really worth all this effort?

87
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:48,989
What can I do?

88
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,326
Otherwise, I have to pay him
100 times the contract amount.

89
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,702
100 times?

90
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:56,163
100 times, my ass.

91
00:04:56,246 --> 00:05:00,083
Did Ha-ri get spooked
by some absurd lie again?

92
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,835
He was going to press charges.

93
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,629
He would have found out my real name

94
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:05,881
and the fact that I work for his company.

95
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:08,258
Then what would happen? I'd get fired and…

96
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:11,678
Look, this is the best I can do.

97
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:18,268
So how's the studying coming along
on your fake boyfriend?

98
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,229
The more I learn,
the more unbelievable he seems.

99
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:24,066
Not only was he was born with
a diamond spoon in his mouth,

100
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:26,610
but he's also smart
and good at sports. Plus, he's hot.

101
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,780
But his parents passed away in
an accident when he was young.

102
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,409
Hey, I heard about that.

103
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:36,912
That's why there are no relatives
in any of the subsidiaries.

104
00:05:36,995 --> 00:05:39,122
-Really? Why?
-Don't even get me started.

105
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,379
Rumor had it that someone was behind
the accident that killed his parents.

106
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:46,296
Really?

107
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:50,133
I mean, I have no idea
if that's the truth or not.

108
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:53,720
But apparently, Chairman Kang fired
all his blood relatives to protect him.

109
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,269
Yes!

110
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,112
What is it this time?

111
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,449
-Hello?
-<i>Where are you right now?</i>

112
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:17,160
Where else would I be at this hour?
Of course, I'm at home.

113
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,078
What is it?

114
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:24,334
I thought it would be best to discuss
this in a private space.

115
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,461
Oh, okay.

116
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:28,380
Did you memorize everything?

117
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:29,464
Yes.

118
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:32,634
Graduated from Hyunil schools.
Got into Harvard in 2010.

119
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:34,177
That's my grandson!

120
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,555
Joined go food after graduation.

121
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:40,225
After the success of Woorigo series
of bone broth, you were promoted quickly

122
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:43,395
and abruptly went to the New York
branch. As for your hobbies--

123
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:44,604
Enough!

124
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,356
What are you doing?

125
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,736
I heard that the chairman
was very thorough,

126
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,613
so I memorized
your entire profile just in case.

127
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:55,657
Do you think he'll ask you to recite it?

128
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:57,993
Still, I'm impressed, Ms. Shin.

129
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,163
You can't lose if you do it by the book.

130
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:04,291
Ask me anything. I'll get it right.

131
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:05,417
Is that so?

132
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:09,004
Then, if my grandfather asked to see you
on Saturday, two weeks from now,

133
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,758
what would be the correct way to respond?

134
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:20,640
Well, there's no real reason to say no
if your grandfather is asking to see me.

135
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:22,934
-So shouldn't I just say, sure?
-Wrong!

136
00:07:24,353 --> 00:07:26,188
-"No" is the right answer.
-Why?

137
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:28,732
That day is our one-year anniversary.

138
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:30,734
Don't couples usually

139
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,071
spend time together on days like that?

140
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,284
-Are you sure you studied properly?
-But that was a trick question.

141
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:41,870
That's why simple memorization
won't always work.

142
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:44,998
Let me ask you something too, then.

143
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:50,212
What was I wearing when we first met?

144
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:52,214
-How could I possibly know that?
-Wrong!

145
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:56,426
Of course, you should remember!
After all, it was the first day we met.

146
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:04,810
<i>On the day we first met,
it was raining in New York.</i>

147
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,147
<i>Just so you know, I looked up
the actual weather that day in New York.</i>

148
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:26,206
That was as beautiful as the player I heard
at the Lincoln Center. Thank you.

149
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,024
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:55,068
No, it's fine. Are you all right?

151
00:08:55,152 --> 00:08:56,111
Yeah.

152
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,698
His clothes look expensive.

153
00:09:00,282 --> 00:09:02,659
What if he asks me
to pay for the dry cleaning?

154
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,536
Are you Korean?

155
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:06,746
Yes.

156
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:08,999
You too?

157
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,668
<i>Falling in love just like that?</i>

158
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,961
<i>That's too unlikely.</i>

159
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:18,175
Why? I think your grandfather
will be completely fooled

160
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,844
with the details
about the weather and everything.

161
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:22,929
I don't like rainy days.

162
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,681
Let's change the date instead.

163
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:34,357
You really don't have to drop me off.

164
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,859
It's late. Just accept the ride.

165
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:39,863
Yes, it wouldn't be right to let
a woman go home alone at this hour.

166
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:40,864
Okay.

167
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:44,284
Thank you so much.

168
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,610
We must be pretty close by now.

169
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:20,987
What? We still have a bit more to go.

170
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:23,907
I guess I was wrong,

171
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:28,662
That hurt.

172
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,512
I'll see you this weekend, then.

173
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:59,985
About Ms. Shin, isn't there something
oddly endearing about her?

174
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:02,696
Is being overly emotional
and easily distracted endearing?

175
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:14,040
Why are you smiling?

176
00:11:14,124 --> 00:11:14,958
It's nothing.

177
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:29,973
Go on a blind date next week.

178
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,645
Are you pretending you don't know?
Or do you really not know?

179
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:38,148
Have you not heard
anything about my blind dates?

180
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,149
I've heard.

181
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,401
Yet you still want me to go on
blind dates?

182
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:44,529
That's why I looked internationally
instead of domestically.

183
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:45,655
Dad!

184
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:49,326
Do you want the rumors that I'm crazy
to reach international waters too?

185
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,328
I don't want to be set up with anyone!

186
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,538
You can't only do
the things you want to do.

187
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:56,583
As my heiress, you have responsibilities--

188
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,669
So you want me to have
an arranged marriage just like you?

189
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:02,505
You weren't happy,
and that's why you divorced.

190
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,549
Why do you want me
to go down the same path?

191
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:05,884
We…

192
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,930
-That was because your mom was eccentric.
-I'm just as eccentric as mom is.

193
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:13,892
I won't get married if I'm not in love.

194
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:16,186
So stop meddling in my life.

195
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:19,022
You insolent…

196
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:22,317
If you plan on acting however you please,
then move out!

197
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,902
Fine, I will.

198
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:26,696
I know you're famous for not
taking back anything you say.

199
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,782
So I'll do exactly as you ordered.

200
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:30,658
Hey, you…

201
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:35,872
Wait!

202
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,415
Wait.

203
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:43,296
I won't stop you from living on your own.

204
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,298
-But…
-But what?

205
00:12:45,382 --> 00:12:47,884
-Leave my credit card behind.
-What?

206
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:51,763
Do you not know what it means
to be truly independent?

207
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:56,059
True independence is
living off the money you earn yourself.

208
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,578
What are you going to do
now that you have to eat your meals alone?

209
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,248
Taking away the credit card is
such a petty move.

210
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:24,921
In just three years, our dumplings now
make up the largest share

211
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,423
within the domestic market.

212
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:30,135
Furthermore, we are on the verge
of reaching a global sales revenue

213
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:33,346
of a trillion won, with the US
sales revenue being 400 billion won.

214
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:36,266
Let's have a round of applause!

215
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,517
Everyone, stop!

216
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,396
Our overseas market share
hasn't caught up with China's yet,

217
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:43,523
and you think it's time to clap?

218
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,151
I'm sorry, sir.

219
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:47,652
Have you set up a countermeasure?

220
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:50,155
Pardon? A countermeasure?

221
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:52,907
Well, that's…

222
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:55,201
I mean, a countermeasure--

223
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:57,954
If you're just going to read off
what your subordinates wrote for you,

224
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,373
you don't need to attend
these meetings from now on.

225
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:03,209
Now, let's move onto the next topic.

226
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:06,629
The Food Product Development Division's
"A Collaboration With the Chef".

227
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,757
Food Product Development Team 3…

228
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:12,677
will be under the direction
of Chef Jang Michelle.

229
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:14,429
-Michelle?
-That famous chef?

230
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:16,264
The super famous French chef?

231
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:18,558
How is Team 1 progressing on this?

232
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:20,852
Well…

233
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:25,690
We were developing an Italian family-style
meal with Chef Park Chun, but…

234
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:28,651
CHEF PARK CHUN'S BULLYING SCANDAL
ALL ACTIVITIES HALTED

235
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,988
This chef was just getting famous
but he turned out to be a bully?

236
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,656
I knew something was off about him

237
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,742
when he crushed garlic with his fists.

238
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:38,620
But then what about the dish
that we were working on?

239
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:40,497
Well, that's off the table now.

240
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:44,459
-How did it go?
-How do you think?

241
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:47,378
I got yelled at for not looking
into the chef's private life.

242
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:50,089
I told them that we would
look for another chef.

243
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:53,426
-Actually, I've already found a few.
-Yeah.

244
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,178
This chef is famous for his seafood.

245
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,095
CHEF HA JAE-WON

246
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:57,013
CHEF LEE JONG-JAE

247
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,974
This chef had a lot of TV exposure,
so he's already well-known.

248
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:04,604
But everyone in the industry
knows that we're looking

249
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:07,315
for a replacement for Chef Park.
Will it be okay?

250
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:11,069
Oh, Ms. Shin.

251
00:15:11,152 --> 00:15:13,738
How about Chef Lee Min-woo?

252
00:15:13,822 --> 00:15:15,114
-Min-woo?
-Yeah.

253
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:17,992
He's new, and his food is good.
Wouldn't he be a good fit?

254
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:20,036
Of course. That's why I recommended him.

255
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,496
Is he clean though?

256
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:25,583
He looks like a womanizer. What if
he causes a scandal after we hire him?

257
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,294
Don't bad-mouth an innocent guy
when you have no other alternatives.

258
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:30,046
I'm not bad-mouthing him.

259
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:33,633
He's just popular with girls.

260
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:37,846
Didn't you see him
completely reject Hye-ji?

261
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:39,138
You're right.

262
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:42,225
Judging by how he rejected me,
I don't think we'll have a problem.

263
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,228
Plus, he's super handsome,
and his food is great too!

264
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,605
I think we have a real shot at winning!

265
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:49,732
That's what I'm saying.

266
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,777
Get things ready so we can submit
a recommendation tomorrow.

267
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:54,362
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good.

268
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:06,875
You know, I even like
the name of your future wife.

269
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,585
Shin Geum-hui.

270
00:16:09,252 --> 00:16:12,547
She has the same name as the
main character from my favorite TV show.

271
00:16:13,715 --> 00:16:14,674
<i>Let me hear it first.</i>

272
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:22,056
Gwang-bok and Geum-hui
are finally together!

273
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,141
<i>BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI</i>

274
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:37,655
What kind of show makes the characters
get together after just one kiss?

275
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:39,157
This show is the worst.

276
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,242
Don't watch things like this.

277
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,912
Hey, what do you mean it's the worst?

278
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:48,249
Listen here, this show is hitting 27%
in viewership.

279
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:51,252
You just need to get into it.

280
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:58,927
Hey.

281
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:07,060
-Can you focus on the garnish?
-Okay.

282
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,187
-Wow, this is so good.
-Hey!

283
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,564
Have you been starving?
You should eat more slowly.

284
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:14,400
I haven't eaten all day because
I was looking for apartments at lunch.

285
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:16,861
Seriously, why did you move out?

286
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:19,405
Do you even have money
to get your own place?

287
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:22,450
You all seem to think that
I've been living off of my dad's money.

288
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:24,744
But I've saved up my paychecks.

289
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:27,455
Oh, sure. I'm sure you've saved a lot…

290
00:17:28,122 --> 00:17:30,500
Min-woo, what about the
white kimchi ravioli?

291
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:32,877
I just called it ravioli,

292
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:36,214
but I made it with whatever I had at hand.
It's not even on the menu.

293
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:38,257
No. I think it'll make a perfect product.

294
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:40,551
A Korean-style ravioli.

295
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:43,096
-It's new.
-I don't know. Do you think it'll work?

296
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:45,723
Hey, don't you trust my taste buds?

297
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:49,102
I like your food for a reason, you know.
Go and make some, quick.

298
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:50,311
Okay.

299
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,904
"I like your food."

300
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:03,074
"And, I like you too."

301
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:09,414
I guess you don't want to
sleep over at my place tonight?

302
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:14,711
"I feel like sleeping out
on the streets tonight!"

303
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:17,588
-I'm sorry.
-Right?

304
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:18,506
Go eat.

305
00:18:21,551 --> 00:18:24,053
What kind of security deposit
is this expensive?

306
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:27,265
This place doesn't even look like
it's half as big as my bedroom.

307
00:18:27,348 --> 00:18:30,727
I thought you said you saved all your
paychecks without spending a cent.

308
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,395
So you were exaggerating.

309
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,940
On top of rent,
I also need to buy furniture,

310
00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:38,317
and my living expenses
will be pretty high too.

311
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:39,235
Oh, that's right.

312
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:44,240
So I was thinking.
Should I just live with you?

313
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,658
In this room?

314
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:50,788
It was just a thought.
I'm going to get my own place!

315
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:52,540
You're a mean girl.

316
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:09,682
RECOMMENDATION
CHEF LEE MIN-WOO

317
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:22,487
It's so loud.

318
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:25,865
Turn off that alarm.

319
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:30,286
"Turn off the alarm"?
Get up. You're going to be late.

320
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,497
Ha-ri?

321
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,916
You fell asleep like this?
Your back will hurt.

322
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:40,296
Ha-ri, get up! Wake up!
Get up, you need to go to work.

323
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,506
What time is it?

324
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:42,632
What time do you think?

325
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:45,093
Oh, my God!

326
00:19:45,176 --> 00:19:47,220
I haven't finished this! What do I do?

327
00:19:47,303 --> 00:19:48,888
Get up and eat something first.

328
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:50,389
What? Food?

329
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:52,183
Right, I need to eat.

330
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:55,019
When did I fall asleep?
Wait, the recommendation…

331
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:58,022
Wait, I think I got to the part
about social media…

332
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:01,317
-Ms. Yeo.
-Yes?

333
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:04,695
I made the profile for Chef Lee
that you requested,

334
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:07,240
along with a proposal
for our collaboration.

335
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:10,326
Goodness, did you really finish
all of this in one day?

336
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,537
I had some ideas
from the last recommendation,

337
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,205
so it didn't take me very long.

338
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,711
White kimchi ravioli?

339
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:24,215
I wanted to cater to Korean taste buds

340
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:28,177
by using white kimchi for the filling.

341
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:31,722
Well, if it's dumplings,
then it can be mass-produced for sure.

342
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,726
What's this?

343
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,937
I thought President Kang
and other directors

344
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,273
might not know a lot about
Min-woo or his cooking,

345
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:43,609
so I compiled a list of reviews
for his dishes from social media.

346
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:46,404
THE RAVIOLI IS THE BEST!

347
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:48,406
IT'S QUITE GOOD, AND THE CHEF'S HANDSOME

348
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:50,616
Wow, he's really popular with women.

349
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,451
Yes. I think that will be an advantage

350
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:55,621
when we're marketing the products to
customers in their 20s and 30s.

351
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:57,582
But white kimchi ravioli?

352
00:20:57,665 --> 00:20:59,208
Don't you think it's a bit risky?

353
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,377
I actually put some thought into that too.

354
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,212
We can just change the filling.

355
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:06,424
Like meat dumplings or kimchi dumplings.

356
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:08,968
The filling uses ricotta cheese as a base,

357
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:12,263
but there's an Italian version
using Italian sausages as well, and…

358
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:17,685
I can't. How am I supposed
to give a presentation to the president?

359
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:18,686
Why can't you?

360
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:21,522
You just need to do what you did
in front of me a moment ago.

361
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:24,942
It'd be better if you gave
the presentation, Ms. Yeo…

362
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:27,528
I've never had Chef Lee's ravioli,

363
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:32,116
and above all, I can't explain things
as well as you do.

364
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,410
-Let's go.
-Please, just wait.

365
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,037
She's right, Ms. Shin.

366
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,998
Director Go got yelled at so much
yesterday for making a mistake

367
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:42,376
while reading off of the papers that
a subordinate wrote for him.

368
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:45,963
Then you give the presentation, Mr. Gye.

369
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:48,132
Don't you know that Mr. Gye
has stage fright?

370
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:49,967
-You need to do it, Ms. Shin.
-One second.

371
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,677
I'm already feeling nervous.

372
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:54,555
This is a great opportunity
to get President Kang's attention.

373
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:57,391
<i>It's because I shouldn't be
grabbing his attention right now.</i>

374
00:21:57,475 --> 00:22:01,604
Ms. Shin! Don't let me get embarrassed
in front of everyone and let's go!

375
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,855
Let's go!

376
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:05,066
Yeah, okay. Bye.

377
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:05,983
Wait!

378
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:09,028
A COLLABORATION WITH THE CHEF
CHEF RECOMMENDATIONS

379
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:10,154
Development Team 1,

380
00:22:10,237 --> 00:22:11,948
is the chef list ready?

381
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:13,783
Actually…

382
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:18,287
Ms. Shin was supposed
to present for our team.

383
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,830
Why, is there a problem?

384
00:22:20,414 --> 00:22:21,832
Well, that's…

385
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,468
I'm sorry for being late.

386
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:36,555
Hello, my name is Shin Ha-ri, from
Food Product Development Team 1.

387
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:38,891
The chef we're recommending--

388
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:40,226
You're going to present like this?

389
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:45,481
-Sir?
-Remove your mask. It's hard to hear you.

390
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:47,984
The mask…

391
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:56,575
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

392
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:20,391
I actually have a cold.

393
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,268
Just keep it on then.

394
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:28,232
Yes, sir.

395
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:36,198
The chef that we are recommending
is Chef Lee Min-woo of M Kitchen.

396
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,492
And the main menu is white kimchi ravioli.

397
00:23:38,993 --> 00:23:42,455
The reason we are recommending this
chef is because of his genre of cooking…

398
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:45,958
Look, this place is in the middle of Seoul
and close to subway stations.

399
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:47,251
It's a great location.

400
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:50,755
So all these appliances come
with the apartment, right?

401
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:53,132
Of course, they come with the apartment!

402
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:55,634
There's a room too…

403
00:23:55,718 --> 00:23:56,927
It's big.

404
00:23:57,011 --> 00:23:58,971
In my 20 years working as a realtor,

405
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:01,682
I've never met anyone
as easy to please as you, miss.

406
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:03,350
I'm kind of like that.

407
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:05,478
Let's go down and write out the contract.

408
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:06,437
Sure.

409
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,980
The elevator's here.

410
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:17,907
Printing out the ingredient analysis
took so long that I'm late.

411
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,118
I need to hurry up and tell Min-woo!

412
00:24:25,414 --> 00:24:27,249
Huh? I thought it was closing time.

413
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:29,418
Are there still customers?

414
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:38,302
Come on.

415
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:43,390
You can't just do that all of a sudden.
Look, I spilled this everywhere!

416
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:57,321
Ha-ri.

417
00:24:59,907 --> 00:25:01,492
It's been a while, Ha-ri.

418
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,829
Yeah. It's good to see you, Yoo-ra.

419
00:25:04,912 --> 00:25:06,997
You're here for work, right?

420
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:08,666
Oh, should I let you guys talk?

421
00:25:08,749 --> 00:25:10,376
Oh, no, it's okay.

422
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,087
No, we can just talk later. It's fine.

423
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,880
-Bye.
-Wait…

424
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:38,237
<i>Sorry. Were you shocked?
I was going to tell you before, but…</i>

425
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,533
<i>You've only had eyes on Yoo-ra
all this time.</i>

426
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,128
<i>But I still wanted to stay by your side
even just as a friend.</i>

427
00:25:55,462 --> 00:25:58,716
<i>Because I thought that maybe you'd
look at me the same way one day.</i>

428
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,467
<i>That you might notice</i>

429
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,344
<i>how much I like you.</i>

430
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,264
Yoo-ra wants to break up.

431
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,308
<i>I really thought that.</i>

432
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:20,779
That's my bus.

433
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:26,202
Sorry!

434
00:26:46,222 --> 00:26:47,097
ARCHAEOPTERYX

435
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:48,974
<i>Hello?</i>

436
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:50,309
Ms. Shin.

437
00:26:51,352 --> 00:26:52,311
Ms. Shin?

438
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:57,816
Oh, my.

439
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:02,738
Here you go.

440
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,157
ARCHAEOPTERYX

441
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:06,742
Thank you.

442
00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:10,579
It must've hurt. Be careful.

443
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,669
It does hurt.

444
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:23,801
I thought it wouldn't,

445
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:30,349
but it hurts.

446
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:34,979
It hurts so much.

447
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,975
I wonder what happened.

448
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:27,489
Ninety-nine…

449
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,074
One hundred…

450
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:34,580
Nobody will be able to tell
that I was crying now, right?

451
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:36,790
All right.

452
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:38,959
Wig…

453
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:41,295
Oh, makeup.

454
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:47,968
A DAY TO SKETCH

455
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,056
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HA-RI
FROM MIN-WOO

456
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:57,478
This show is today?

457
00:28:59,688 --> 00:29:01,857
Why are you so spooked?
Mom says to come eat.

458
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,485
No, I need to go out.
I'm meeting someone today.

459
00:29:05,653 --> 00:29:07,196
Hey! I like this group too.

460
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:09,114
This show is today.

461
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:11,867
If you're not going to go,
can I have this?

462
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:23,295
RECENT CALLS
ARCHAEOPTERYX

463
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:24,421
What?

464
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:28,133
I never talked to him yesterday.

465
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:29,259
What is this?

466
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,470
No way. Last night…

467
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:38,560
-Hi.
-Get in.

468
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:41,188
-You drove here yourself?
-This is a personal affair.

469
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:58,706
Did you call me yesterday?

470
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:01,125
I didn't know, but I saw
I had a call from you last night.

471
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:05,129
I'd called about today, but I hung up
because I couldn't hear anything. Why?

472
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:07,673
Nothing.

473
00:30:11,218 --> 00:30:13,512
The weather is really nice today!

474
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:23,147
Maybe I should've taken
something to calm my nerves.

475
00:30:23,814 --> 00:30:26,525
Are you nervous?
Didn't you say you've got this?

476
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:30,154
Mr. Cha said that your grandfather
is a really scary and strict person.

477
00:30:30,237 --> 00:30:33,157
If he realizes that we're lying to him…

478
00:30:33,741 --> 00:30:37,327
If you're scared, then while we're inside,
try to love me for real.

479
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:41,123
What?

480
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:43,041
Let's go.

481
00:30:44,835 --> 00:30:45,878
Okay.

482
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:50,716
We're here.

483
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,967
Hey.

484
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:59,016
Ms. Shin Geum-hui!
You're as beautiful as I imagined.

485
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:04,396
Not her. Her.

486
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:06,023
What?

487
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:08,734
Oh, my.

488
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:11,069
Nice to meet you.

489
00:31:11,153 --> 00:31:12,362
Yes, hello.

490
00:31:24,374 --> 00:31:28,837
You said that you majored
in art in New York?

491
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,297
Oh, yes, sir.

492
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,550
I suppose that's why you seem so unique.

493
00:31:37,971 --> 00:31:39,473
<i>Since I was meeting the chairman,</i>

494
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:42,768
<i>I put on a lot of makeup so I wouldn't
get busted, but was it overkill?</i>

495
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,899
Try this dish, sir.

496
00:31:48,982 --> 00:31:51,193
They say potatoes are
good for hypertension.

497
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,529
Tae-moo told me about your hypertension.

498
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,280
I have diabetes, too.

499
00:31:55,989 --> 00:31:58,992
Some bland vegetables like these
are probably better

500
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:03,497
than anything that's been cooked to be
all sweet and salty, right?

501
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,835
Ah, indeed. Eating habits are important,

502
00:32:07,918 --> 00:32:10,170
but it's even better to combine it
with exercise.

503
00:32:10,254 --> 00:32:12,506
I heard that you like hiking, right?

504
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:13,507
Yes, I do.

505
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,509
Do you like hiking as well, Ms. Shin?

506
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:17,594
Yes, I like it a lot!

507
00:32:17,678 --> 00:32:19,346
Tae-moo, do you remember?

508
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:21,682
On Mount Brunni in Switzerland,

509
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:25,143
we enjoyed the stars together all night.
It was beautiful.

510
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:26,520
-Ms. Shin.
-Yes.

511
00:32:26,603 --> 00:32:29,481
Do you love Tae-moo?

512
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,655
Of course!
I'm dating him because I love him.

513
00:32:37,948 --> 00:32:40,200
Then why did you break up?

514
00:32:42,077 --> 00:32:43,036
That's…

515
00:32:44,621 --> 00:32:48,083
Grandfather. You can't just ask something
like that so directly--

516
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,420
I'm asking because it's something
that needs to be asked, you rascal.

517
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:52,629
Come on, answer me.

518
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,215
Well…

519
00:32:56,049 --> 00:32:59,344
I thought that he cared about
work more than he did about me.

520
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:02,723
Tae-moo is someone who knows nothing
besides work.

521
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:07,144
That won't change in the future, either.
Are you okay with that?

522
00:33:07,227 --> 00:33:09,271
Because you'll keep fighting about it.

523
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,981
Don't worry.

524
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:12,774
When we talked things over this time,

525
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:17,029
I decided I would understand that Tae-moo
prioritizes work over everything else.

526
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:18,488
He was so crazy about his work

527
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:21,825
that I ignored all his calls
after telling him "let's break up."

528
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:25,996
But he canceled an important meeting
he had scheduled and ran over to see me.

529
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,331
This boy

530
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:30,334
really skipped a meeting to go see you?

531
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:31,335
Yes.

532
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:36,173
On top of that, you know how
Tae-moo hates the rain, right?

533
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,551
It was raining that day,
and yet he still came.

534
00:33:40,802 --> 00:33:42,679
Is that true, Tae-moo?

535
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:49,770
Let's eat first and discuss that later.
The food's getting cold.

536
00:33:49,853 --> 00:33:51,730
What? Oh, right.

537
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:55,567
-Really?
-Yes.

538
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:01,073
The password is
written on top of the router.

539
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:02,699
Oh, okay. Thank you.

540
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:08,288
-Well, then.
-Thank you so much.

541
00:34:08,372 --> 00:34:11,124
-Your sofa is here.
-Yes, I'm coming!

542
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:17,714
-Hello.
-Hello. The sofa's here! One moment.

543
00:34:17,798 --> 00:34:19,091
Where should we put it?

544
00:34:19,174 --> 00:34:21,843
I'm going to place it in the living room.

545
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,762
-Please be careful.
-Did you order <i>Jajangmyeon</i>?

546
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:25,973
Yes. Everyone seems
to have come all at once.

547
00:34:26,056 --> 00:34:29,351
Could you wait with the food
for a moment so the sofa can go in first?

548
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:33,313
-Sure thing.
-Oh, the sofa, can go right here.

549
00:34:33,397 --> 00:34:34,439
Okay.

550
00:34:34,982 --> 00:34:38,318
It looks like someone finally
moved in next door.

551
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:40,654
-I have a package for you.
-Yes.

552
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,866
-Hello.
-Hello.

553
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:45,909
Thank you.

554
00:34:45,993 --> 00:34:49,121
Could you please be
a bit more careful with the sofa?

555
00:34:49,204 --> 00:34:50,706
I paid a lot of money for that.

556
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,250
-Package for you!
-Yes, please put it in front of the door.

557
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:54,751
Okay.

558
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:56,294
Careful.

559
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:00,132
-Oh, I need to pay, right?
-That will be 6,000 won.

560
00:35:00,215 --> 00:35:02,217
Looks like my new neighbor's loud.

561
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:04,177
-Thanks.
-One second, I can--

562
00:35:04,261 --> 00:35:05,595
-It's all right.
-Oh. Okay.

563
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,431
Enjoy your meal. It's fine.

564
00:35:14,451 --> 00:35:16,245
I've been looking for you forever!

565
00:35:16,328 --> 00:35:19,832
It was so awkward being with
your grandfather by myself, I was dying.

566
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:21,625
Hey, didn't I do well just now?

567
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:23,711
I don't think he liked me
very much at first,

568
00:35:23,794 --> 00:35:25,921
but once I talked to him
about the rainy day,

569
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:27,590
he started getting into my story--

570
00:35:27,673 --> 00:35:28,966
Why did you bring that up?

571
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:30,843
What do you mean?

572
00:35:30,926 --> 00:35:32,177
That I ran to see you

573
00:35:32,845 --> 00:35:34,513
on a rainy day.

574
00:35:34,597 --> 00:35:36,557
You said that you don't like the rain.

575
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,642
So I added some truth to make
the story more realistic.

576
00:35:38,726 --> 00:35:41,437
You ran to your lover
even though you hate the rain.

577
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,189
-How romantic is that?
-You must be mistaken.

578
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:47,401
But our relationship is
simply a contractual exchange of money.

579
00:35:47,484 --> 00:35:48,736
Yes, right.

580
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:51,196
So don't act like
we're anything actually real.

581
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,450
Just answer his questions and don't
add any of your useless comments.

582
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:55,367
Got it?

583
00:35:57,828 --> 00:35:58,662
Okay.

584
00:35:58,746 --> 00:35:59,914
Ms. Shin.

585
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:02,124
Yes, sir.

586
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:05,377
Do you, by any chance,

587
00:36:06,003 --> 00:36:07,713
like steamed buns?

588
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:09,882
Grandfather, today is--

589
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:11,842
I wasn't asking you.

590
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,219
Ms. Shin, do you like them?

591
00:36:14,803 --> 00:36:17,389
Steamed buns…

592
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:20,225
Yes, I like steamed buns.

593
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:25,147
Then let's go eat
some steamed buns for dessert.

594
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,191
Let's take my car from here.

595
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:32,821
Damn steamed buns.

596
00:36:34,823 --> 00:36:37,993
What did rain ever do to him?
Why is he being so touchy?

597
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:40,204
Wait for me, Tae-moo!

598
00:36:40,287 --> 00:36:42,706
SUNRISE REALTOR
IBO CONVENIENCE STORE

599
00:36:45,626 --> 00:36:47,878
Chairman Kang, hello!

600
00:36:48,963 --> 00:36:50,172
Have you been well?

601
00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:51,757
Of course, all thanks to you.

602
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,716
Let's go in.

603
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,842
After you.

604
00:36:53,926 --> 00:36:56,053
We came all the way to Anheung
for steamed buns?

605
00:36:56,136 --> 00:36:58,764
Don't complain.
You brought this on yourself.

606
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:02,476
Hey, what did I do that was so bad?

607
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,771
I just answered his questions
like you told me to.

608
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:10,567
What? Did I say something wrong?

609
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:12,945
I just did my best to do well…

610
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:19,785
-What are you suddenly doing?
-Your grandfather is watching.

611
00:37:19,868 --> 00:37:21,161
Let's go, quickly.

612
00:37:21,245 --> 00:37:23,163
Let's go, Tae-moo.

613
00:37:23,247 --> 00:37:25,165
Here, eat.

614
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:26,291
Okay.

615
00:37:27,334 --> 00:37:28,293
Let's see.

616
00:37:32,589 --> 00:37:34,049
That's tasty.

617
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:37,678
They really are.

618
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:41,682
The bread is fermented really well.
The red bean filling is soft, too.

619
00:37:41,765 --> 00:37:43,851
It was definitely worth the trip out here!

620
00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:49,523
Hey, you got some red bean on your teeth.

621
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:50,733
My teeth? Oh, my!

622
00:37:51,233 --> 00:37:52,901
What were the conditions?

623
00:37:54,153 --> 00:37:54,987
Yes.

624
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,988
Have a drink.

625
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:56,989
Oh, yes, sir.

626
00:37:58,157 --> 00:37:59,408
There we go.

627
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:00,492
Thank you.

628
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:06,165
That's it.

629
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:11,879
I apologize for today.

630
00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:13,172
What do you mean?

631
00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:15,424
For acting so stiff when I first saw you.

632
00:38:16,258 --> 00:38:21,555
My first impression of the way
you were dressed wasn't the best.

633
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:24,058
I'm sorry.

634
00:38:24,141 --> 00:38:25,893
It's all right, I understand.

635
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,104
<i>I'm surprised
every time I look at myself, too.</i>

636
00:38:29,188 --> 00:38:30,564
Oh, and…

637
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:32,107
thank you.

638
00:38:33,025 --> 00:38:34,234
Thanks for what?

639
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:36,195
Just for everything.

640
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:42,242
Anyway, it looks like Tae-moo
really cares about you, Ms. Shin.

641
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:44,953
Please keep taking good care of him.

642
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:46,705
Sure.

643
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:48,248
All right.

644
00:38:52,336 --> 00:38:54,129
Oh, my.

645
00:38:54,713 --> 00:38:57,925
-Are you all right, Ms. Shin?
-Oh, my. Yes. I'll pick those up.

646
00:39:03,138 --> 00:39:06,058
-Oh, thank you.
-Here you go.

647
00:39:07,142 --> 00:39:08,393
My goodness.

648
00:39:09,603 --> 00:39:10,813
A DAY TO SKETCH

649
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:14,650
Let's go back to Seoul.
I have some business to take care of.

650
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:16,068
Business to take care of?

651
00:39:16,944 --> 00:39:19,363
It's because you always act like that

652
00:39:19,446 --> 00:39:23,575
that Ms. Shin can't even ask you
about things like this.

653
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:24,993
What did I…

654
00:39:25,077 --> 00:39:27,162
-What are those?
-They're concert tickets.

655
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:31,333
Seeing as how they're for today,
she must have bought them to go with you.

656
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:32,501
Right, Ms. Shin?

657
00:39:33,377 --> 00:39:35,462
-What?
-Get going right away!

658
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:38,090
Come on!

659
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:39,758
Here, take it!

660
00:39:39,842 --> 00:39:40,884
Let's go, come on.

661
00:39:40,968 --> 00:39:42,469
That little…

662
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,487
This is so nice.

663
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,616
I'm completely broke
after buying this sofa, though.

664
00:40:05,325 --> 00:40:07,161
Should I have bought a cheaper one?

665
00:40:11,748 --> 00:40:12,708
No.

666
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:16,420
This is a gift to myself to celebrate
my first time moving out on my own.

667
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:17,921
Good job, Young-seo.

668
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:23,302
It feels so good!

669
00:40:25,304 --> 00:40:26,847
I'm so hungry.

670
00:40:27,347 --> 00:40:29,224
Is moving always this hard?

671
00:40:31,518 --> 00:40:32,561
Okay.

672
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,981
Is there a draft coming in from somewhere?

673
00:40:40,235 --> 00:40:41,278
What?

674
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,744
Cockroach!

675
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:50,871
I hate cockroaches!

676
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:55,417
I hate them so much!

677
00:41:02,174 --> 00:41:03,634
What's going on?

678
00:41:03,717 --> 00:41:06,553
Sorry, there's a cockroach in my house.

679
00:41:10,682 --> 00:41:11,683
You're…

680
00:41:12,643 --> 00:41:14,436
Ms. Jin, what are you doing here…

681
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:19,274
Oh, well, it's a long story.

682
00:41:20,776 --> 00:41:22,819
I'm sorry, but…

683
00:41:23,779 --> 00:41:26,573
could I ask you for a favor?

684
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,578
It's inside that paper cup.

685
00:41:33,497 --> 00:41:34,373
Right.

686
00:41:39,336 --> 00:41:42,714
Sorry. I'm okay with everything else,
but I'm just really scared of bugs.

687
00:41:45,342 --> 00:41:46,426
Sure.

688
00:42:04,194 --> 00:42:08,699
Will it really die if you just
spray the outside like that?

689
00:42:08,782 --> 00:42:12,077
I'm not sure. Don't you think it's dead
by now if I've sprayed this much?

690
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,287
Do you have another can?

691
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:15,747
Are you scared of bugs?

692
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:18,875
No, it's not that.
They just gross me out, that's all.

693
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:20,961
Isn't that the same thing?

694
00:42:22,337 --> 00:42:23,797
-Oh, my God!
-That scared me.

695
00:42:25,465 --> 00:42:27,801
I'm all right, but are you?

696
00:42:29,886 --> 00:42:30,721
Yeah.

697
00:42:30,804 --> 00:42:32,973
I'll finish it off. Get behind me.

698
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,659
He's using so much of the spray.

699
00:43:00,334 --> 00:43:03,003
I flushed it down the toilet,
so there's no need to worry.

700
00:43:03,587 --> 00:43:05,172
Thank you for helping me.

701
00:43:05,756 --> 00:43:07,007
It was nothing.

702
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,175
Goodbye, then.

703
00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:09,426
Wait.

704
00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:15,307
Meeting like this as neighbors
is kind of fate,

705
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,976
so let's be friends
and get to know each other.

706
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:24,483
I'm sorry, but I don't think that'll work.

707
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,235
What do you…

708
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:29,029
You put Mr. Kang in a difficult position

709
00:43:29,112 --> 00:43:32,240
by sending somebody else on the blind date
to fill in for you.

710
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:37,996
So I just don't think it would be right
for me to get to know you personally.

711
00:43:50,717 --> 00:43:51,968
Wow.

712
00:43:53,053 --> 00:43:55,555
Did I really just get rejected
as a neighbor too?

713
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:57,265
ART CENTER

714
00:44:02,646 --> 00:44:06,483
I said we could go by ourselves but he
had to drop us off in front of the venue…

715
00:44:06,566 --> 00:44:07,943
I know you too well.

716
00:44:08,026 --> 00:44:12,531
It's so obvious you would pretend to go
then go back to work.

717
00:44:12,614 --> 00:44:15,534
I want to watch the two of you
head inside.

718
00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:23,208
Bye.

719
00:44:25,794 --> 00:44:28,755
Let's go in then come back out
when your grandfather's gone.

720
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,384
Go ahead.

721
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:34,219
Goodbye.

722
00:44:34,302 --> 00:44:37,848
He'll probably stay right in front
of the building until the concert starts.

723
00:44:37,931 --> 00:44:39,224
Just give up.

724
00:45:20,473 --> 00:45:24,769
<i>You opened your eyes</i>

725
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:29,065
<i>As the light started to shine</i>

726
00:45:29,149 --> 00:45:35,030
<i>You're like a gift that was prepared</i>

727
00:45:35,113 --> 00:45:37,866
<i>Just for me</i>

728
00:45:37,949 --> 00:45:44,414
<i>All of the small things
Just seem to get bigger</i>

729
00:45:44,497 --> 00:45:50,253
<i>This moment
Where even my plain, everyday life</i>

730
00:45:50,337 --> 00:45:57,344
<i>Becomes special too</i>

731
00:45:58,762 --> 00:46:01,765
A DAY TO SKETCH

732
00:46:01,848 --> 00:46:04,935
We're the ballad duo, Melomance.
Thank you for coming.

733
00:46:05,018 --> 00:46:06,853
Hello, everyone.

734
00:46:06,937 --> 00:46:08,313
MELOMANCE IS OUR GIFT
OUR EVERYTHING, MELOMANCE

735
00:46:09,648 --> 00:46:13,360
As a special event for our audience
members today,

736
00:46:13,443 --> 00:46:16,529
we've taken song requests alongside
their special stories.

737
00:46:16,613 --> 00:46:18,031
They do those things too!

738
00:46:23,954 --> 00:46:26,498
"I've been a fan of yours
for a long time."

739
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:30,543
"I bought tickets for today's show and
gave them to a friend for her birthday."

740
00:46:33,296 --> 00:46:35,715
"We've been good friends
for seven whole years."

741
00:46:36,591 --> 00:46:39,135
"She even bought me drinks
and comforted me

742
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:42,264
when I broke up with my girlfriend
and when I had to go to the army."

743
00:46:42,347 --> 00:46:44,140
"But she doesn't have a boyfriend yet."

744
00:46:44,224 --> 00:46:47,727
"I'm hoping that she'll go to the concert
with her boyfriend."

745
00:46:47,811 --> 00:46:50,355
"I ask that you gift her
with your amazing song."

746
00:46:50,438 --> 00:46:54,025
Row B, seats 42 and 43! Are you here?

747
00:47:02,242 --> 00:47:04,536
You came with a gentleman today!

748
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:06,246
-Oh, no, I…
-He's hot!

749
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:09,082
No…

750
00:47:09,165 --> 00:47:12,168
I guess your friend's wish has come true!

751
00:47:12,252 --> 00:47:14,379
I'm sure he'll be happy.

752
00:47:14,462 --> 00:47:16,715
Congratulations to his friend
of seven years

753
00:47:16,798 --> 00:47:18,675
for coming here today with a gentleman.

754
00:47:19,718 --> 00:47:21,720
-Thank you.
-We'll sing "Love, Maybe,"

755
00:47:21,803 --> 00:47:23,638
as requested.

756
00:47:35,025 --> 00:47:40,947
<i>My days are filled with daydreams</i>

757
00:47:41,031 --> 00:47:44,868
<i>About all the things
That I want to do with you</i>

758
00:47:45,577 --> 00:47:51,166
<i>When I see you happy</i>

759
00:47:51,249 --> 00:47:55,837
<i>All I can do is smile</i>

760
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:00,216
<i>Everything you do makes my heart flutter</i>

761
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,512
<i>And I keep on spending
More nights wide awake</i>

762
00:48:04,596 --> 00:48:07,474
<i>Thinking of all the little things you do</i>

763
00:48:08,266 --> 00:48:09,309
Do you know this song?

764
00:48:09,893 --> 00:48:12,145
Sure. I really like this song.

765
00:48:12,228 --> 00:48:14,856
Really? This one isn't that popular yet.

766
00:48:15,398 --> 00:48:17,776
-Hey, sing it for me some time.
-What?

767
00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:19,277
You're good at singing.

768
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:22,030
I was totally impressed
at the orientation.

769
00:48:23,573 --> 00:48:24,491
Sure.

770
00:48:27,494 --> 00:48:31,873
<i>-This stop is Seoun University.</i>
-Min-woo…

771
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:35,585
<i>The next stop is Donggyo Arts High School.</i>

772
00:48:49,641 --> 00:48:55,438
<i>I spend more and more days</i>

773
00:48:55,522 --> 00:49:00,944
<i>Thinking of all the things
I want to do with you</i>

774
00:49:01,027 --> 00:49:06,991
<i>This must be love</i>

775
00:49:07,075 --> 00:49:12,247
<i>You'd get sick of me
If we spent all of our days together</i>

776
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:18,169
<i>Even when I turn around
You're all I can see</i>

777
00:49:18,253 --> 00:49:22,632
<i>This must be love</i>

778
00:49:22,715 --> 00:49:26,386
Thank you, goodbye!

779
00:50:00,962 --> 00:50:02,172
Watch where you're going.

780
00:50:02,255 --> 00:50:03,381
Thanks.

781
00:50:05,842 --> 00:50:08,511
I'll wash this and give it back to you.

782
00:50:09,637 --> 00:50:11,264
Do you usually cry so easily?

783
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,475
You bawled yesterday too.

784
00:50:13,558 --> 00:50:15,185
But you said you didn't hear--

785
00:50:15,268 --> 00:50:17,312
It seemed like
you didn't want me to know, so…

786
00:50:21,483 --> 00:50:24,194
Thank you for today. For everything.

787
00:50:24,277 --> 00:50:27,197
For pretending you didn't notice
that I cried yesterday

788
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,702
and for coming to the concert with me,
which I would have gone to all by myself.

789
00:50:33,203 --> 00:50:34,454
Not only that.

790
00:50:35,622 --> 00:50:37,957
I almost looked like
a really pitiful person

791
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:40,251
because you cried like that
during the concert.

792
00:50:40,835 --> 00:50:42,712
What are you talking about?

793
00:50:42,795 --> 00:50:45,381
The women next to me were
talking about it pretty loudly.

794
00:50:45,465 --> 00:50:48,009
That I was just your friend's replacement.

795
00:50:51,012 --> 00:50:52,055
I'm sorry.

796
00:50:54,974 --> 00:50:56,184
No need to be sorry.

797
00:50:56,684 --> 00:50:59,604
I mean, it's not like
I'm your real boyfriend.

798
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:04,526
Did you really have a crush on him
for seven years?

799
00:51:05,485 --> 00:51:07,904
Was it really that noticeable?

800
00:51:07,987 --> 00:51:11,282
Isn't it obvious when you add up
your friend's message and your crying?

801
00:51:12,617 --> 00:51:15,119
Anyway, I think you got
your closure today.

802
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,331
Yeah.

803
00:51:18,957 --> 00:51:21,793
I'm going to accept that I got rejected
and end it, clean and simple.

804
00:51:24,587 --> 00:51:28,716
That friend of mine got back together
with his ex-girlfriend.

805
00:51:31,511 --> 00:51:32,804
I don't regret it, though.

806
00:51:34,514 --> 00:51:35,682
I was really happy

807
00:51:37,433 --> 00:51:38,643
for those seven years.

808
00:51:43,106 --> 00:51:47,110
Someone like you who can't tolerate
wasting time can't understand that, right?

809
00:51:50,613 --> 00:51:52,156
Well, it's not always that way.

810
00:51:53,032 --> 00:51:53,950
What?

811
00:51:55,326 --> 00:51:58,371
There are some things that get results
with a short amount of time,

812
00:51:58,454 --> 00:52:01,749
and other things where you risk the
losses and stay in it for the long run.

813
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:05,420
It's difficult to decide how good or bad
something is just by how long it takes.

814
00:52:08,381 --> 00:52:11,217
Why are you laughing?
There's nothing funny about that.

815
00:52:11,926 --> 00:52:13,011
No, it's…

816
00:52:13,094 --> 00:52:16,764
It's funny that you're comparing things
to your job even in a situation like this.

817
00:52:17,307 --> 00:52:20,476
My apologies. I've never tried
to comfort anyone before.

818
00:52:22,437 --> 00:52:24,939
That was comforting enough.

819
00:52:26,441 --> 00:52:30,194
And I'm sorry about this afternoon.

820
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:37,076
I was feeling a little down so I overdid
things a bit so it wouldn't be so obvious.

821
00:52:37,577 --> 00:52:40,455
I think that's why I said
some things I shouldn't have said.

822
00:52:41,914 --> 00:52:44,334
No, I think I was being
a bit sensitive as well.

823
00:52:47,003 --> 00:52:48,796
But where are we going right now?

824
00:52:49,756 --> 00:52:52,091
I was just following you.

825
00:52:52,759 --> 00:52:54,886
But I was following you.

826
00:53:00,558 --> 00:53:01,768
THE BEST COMBINATION
<i>TTEOKBOKKI</i>, FRIED VEGGIES, <i>SUNDAE</i>

827
00:53:03,811 --> 00:53:08,566
Can I have two <i>tteokbokki</i>, one <i>sundae</i>,
and a small fried veggie medley?

828
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,109
Do you want hard-boiled eggs?

829
00:53:10,735 --> 00:53:11,736
No, I'm good.

830
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:14,739
Why? I can afford to buy us a snack.
Eat all you want.

831
00:53:16,366 --> 00:53:17,325
No way!

832
00:53:19,118 --> 00:53:22,080
You're not going to say a line
from a TV show where the rich guy says,

833
00:53:22,163 --> 00:53:23,956
"I've never tried <i>tteokbokki</i>."

834
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,458
What do you take me for?

835
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:28,378
"Deliciously Spicy <i>Tteokbokki</i>"
is one of our products.

836
00:53:28,461 --> 00:53:29,379
I came up with that.

837
00:53:29,462 --> 00:53:32,256
I've been
to all the famous <i>tteokbokki</i> places

838
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,342
all around the country for that project.

839
00:53:36,761 --> 00:53:39,013
-Here you go.
-That looks delicious.

840
00:53:39,097 --> 00:53:40,056
Thank you.

841
00:53:45,895 --> 00:53:46,771
Excuse me.

842
00:53:51,609 --> 00:53:54,487
Hey. I'm still outside.

843
00:53:55,405 --> 00:53:56,364
Dinner?

844
00:53:57,198 --> 00:53:58,825
I think I'm going to eat out.

845
00:53:58,908 --> 00:54:00,660
Watch out!

846
00:54:01,786 --> 00:54:03,955
Ms. Shin! Watch out!

847
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:15,133
Are you all right, Ms. Shin?

848
00:54:15,216 --> 00:54:16,884
Ow, that hurts.

849
00:54:23,224 --> 00:54:24,183
Put this on it.

850
00:54:26,978 --> 00:54:28,146
Thank you.

851
00:54:33,484 --> 00:54:35,820
Aren't you cold? Let me know if you are.

852
00:54:38,322 --> 00:54:39,532
Mr. Kang.

853
00:54:40,408 --> 00:54:43,494
Could I maybe make a small suggestion?

854
00:54:43,578 --> 00:54:45,621
Sure. What is it?

855
00:54:46,998 --> 00:54:49,167
Instead of a fake relationship like this,

856
00:54:49,959 --> 00:54:51,335
why don't you try a real one?

857
00:54:52,211 --> 00:54:55,840
You might think it's a waste of time
to be in a relationship right now,

858
00:54:56,507 --> 00:54:59,802
but if you think long-term,
it might be more efficient.

859
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:02,263
You know, you could even get married.

860
00:55:03,806 --> 00:55:05,266
-Married?
-Yes.

861
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:09,896
Being in a fake relationship with me
means there isn't really a future.

862
00:55:09,979 --> 00:55:12,315
So maybe this is
an even bigger waste of time.

863
00:55:15,693 --> 00:55:16,861
I think the taxi is here.

864
00:55:17,653 --> 00:55:19,447
Well, then. I'm off.

865
00:55:21,783 --> 00:55:24,535
Thank you again for today.

866
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,120
Get home safely.

867
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,918
I'll give you this in return.

868
00:55:32,919 --> 00:55:34,921
I got it as a gift at the concert.

869
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,381
I don't know what it is,

870
00:55:37,465 --> 00:55:40,218
but apparently, it'll cheer you up
when you're feeling down.

871
00:55:41,052 --> 00:55:41,969
Bye!

872
00:55:54,857 --> 00:55:56,025
Wow.

873

875
00:56:17,922 --> 00:56:19,507
TALK TO ME WHEN YOU'RE FEELING DOWN.
I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU.

876
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:23,010
<i>Talk to me when you're feeling down.
I'll be there for you.</i>

877
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:28,307
Be in a real relationship

878
00:56:29,642 --> 00:56:31,143
instead of a fake one?

879
00:56:41,946 --> 00:56:43,239
What do you guys think?

880
00:56:49,996 --> 00:56:51,247
What am I doing?

881
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,529
-What is it?
-What? What's going on?

882
00:56:57,612 --> 00:56:58,989
What happened?

883
00:56:59,072 --> 00:57:01,992
I don't know. Maybe she threw a fit
while sleeping or something?

884
00:57:09,207 --> 00:57:10,751
What am I going to do?

885
00:57:12,085 --> 00:57:14,880
What's wrong with your face?
You scared me.

886
00:57:14,963 --> 00:57:17,799
You think it looks bad too, right?

887
00:57:17,883 --> 00:57:21,303
My goodness. I knew
the bruise would only get bigger.

888
00:57:21,386 --> 00:57:23,972
Who plays catch on the streets at night?

889
00:57:24,056 --> 00:57:27,267
You should've found out who they were
so I could teach them a lesson.

890
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:29,728
It's not like they did it on purpose.
It's okay.

891
00:57:29,811 --> 00:57:32,647
-Look at this.
-Hey, Ha-ri, you look just like that.

892
00:57:32,731 --> 00:57:35,484
<i>Everybody was Kung Fu fighting</i>

893
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:38,653
Do you want to die?

894
00:57:38,737 --> 00:57:40,489
Okay, let's rub it a little bit, okay?

895
00:57:40,572 --> 00:57:43,283
No, it's too late.
Just make me a fried egg with that.

896
00:57:43,366 --> 00:57:45,577
-Okay.
-Just fry the egg.

897
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,537
Can you go to work looking like that?

898
00:57:47,621 --> 00:57:50,582
I have to go.
It's not like I'm dying from this.

899
00:57:52,876 --> 00:57:54,878
What are you doing? Give it to me.

900
00:57:54,961 --> 00:57:57,672
-Get some gloves and finish cleaning.
-Get lost.

<i>There's no way Mr. Kang would recognize me
by my bruise, right?</i>

903
00:58:18,985 --> 00:58:20,612
I almost didn't make it in time.

904
00:58:25,742 --> 00:58:28,245
Will this be enough to cover the bruise?

905

<i>-I realized</i>
