00:00:00,057 --> 00:00:04,839
BUSINESS PROPOSAL

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,866
EPISODE 1

3
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:33,475
I should be arriving in about an hour.

4
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:35,811
Yes, I understand.

5
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:45,404
What the hell?

6
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:50,409
Are you all right?

7
00:00:50,492 --> 00:00:52,703
I was on my phone
and wasn't watching where I was going.

8
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:53,829
This is absurd.

9
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,706
What?

10
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,998
What did you just say?

11
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,501
Don't worry, he wasn't talking to you.

12
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:00,460
And who are--

13
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,093
You should be clearer about
who you're talking to, sir.

14
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:10,220
-She misunderstood--
-Can you believe this ad?

15
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:13,223
You can hardly tell
what product they're promoting.

16
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,434
They've only slapped
some nameless celebrity on it.

17
00:01:15,517 --> 00:01:17,936
You're right.
I've never seen that guy before.

18
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,522
Find out who was in charge
of this ad immediately.

19
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:22,816
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:26,486
PREMIUM DUMPLINGS

21
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,532
DELICIOUS DUMPLINGS MADE WITH CAREFULLY
SELECTED PREMIUM INGREDIENTS

22
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:32,117
"DO YOU WANT TO EAT WITH ME?"

23
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:45,630
APPLE EXTRACT

24
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:54,473
SHIN HA-RI

25
00:01:54,556 --> 00:01:58,685
Yes, Ms. Yeo. Oh, already?
Yes, I'm on my way. Okay.

26
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:07,611
Coming through.

27
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,821
-Ms. Yeo.
-What's this smell?

28
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:11,573
-Hey.
-Why are you so late?

29
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:12,866
Because of the mackerel.

30
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:14,242
Take it easy, will you?

31
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,287
You stink of fish.

32
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,247
Is it that bad? I can't really tell.

33
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:21,082
How could you not? Come here.

34
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,337
It's fine. It's just proof of
how hard you're working as a researcher.

35
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:27,923
INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT KANG TAE-MOO

36
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:30,717
The inauguration will start soon.
Please be seated.

37
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:32,302
-Let's go sit.
-Okay.

38
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:39,518
-Hello.
-This is our new hire, Hye-ji.

39
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:48,360
Anyway, looks like the rumors are true.
President Kang's quite the workaholic.

40
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:51,321
He's starting work
on the day he came back to Korea.

41
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,032
I heard he's really hot.

42
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:57,577
Who knows? He wasn't here when I joined
the company, so I never saw him.

43
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:01,498
But look at the chairman.
How hot could the grandson be?

44
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,584
It's been a long time coming.

45
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:07,587
-So the rumors aren't true.
-No.

46
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:09,923
He's really handsome.
He looks like a celebrity.

47
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:13,260
Please. The apple doesn’t fall far
from the tree, you know.

48
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:15,929
President Kang will now make
his inauguration address.

49
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,597
There he is.

50
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:30,443
He's super hot!

51
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:31,820
That's…

52
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:37,659
-Hello, everyone.
-Why is he…

53
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:42,330
I am Chief Secretary Cha Sung-hoon,
here on behalf of President Kang.

54
00:03:42,914 --> 00:03:44,124
What's going on?

55
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:45,208
The chief secretary?

56
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:48,336
I will now deliver
his inauguration address.

57
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,337
What is this…

58
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:55,177
"Thank you to everyone
who arranged today's ceremony,

59
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,471
even though I clearly told you
that I didn't want one."

60
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,392
"I hope going forward,
we will meet for business matters,

61
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,769
not for such impractical
and ceremonial events."

62
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,771
"I will properly introduce myself soon."

63
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:08,148
-Is that it?
-"Thank you."

64
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:11,651
-"President Kang Tae-moo." That'll be all.
-This is amazing.

65
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:15,655
God, these bastards! Damn it!

66
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:19,159
Oh, he's mad!

67
00:04:20,118 --> 00:04:21,077
Look!

68
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:25,248
So where is the president?

69
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,460
The new president sure
seems like an interesting person.

70
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:36,176
Why won't it just go straight? Come on!

71
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:41,681
Come on, you're just stressed
because of the chairman's grandson.

72
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:45,602
Yes. Everyone thought you were
going to become the new president.

73
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,187
That kid snatched it away.

74
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,898
We still believe in you, Mr. Park!

75
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:52,317
I think this might help you feel better.

76
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,322
What's this? And what's with
that suspicious look on your face?

77
00:04:57,989 --> 00:04:59,115
Ta-da!

78
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:02,911
I tucked the rest nicely
in the trunk of your car.

79
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:05,080
What is this?

80
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:07,415
It's beautiful!

81
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:25,141
It went in!

82
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,768
That was amazing!

83
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:29,729
But who the hell was that?
Where are your manners?

84
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:49,082
It's been a while, Mr. Park.

85
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:54,921
Look who it is? Tae-moo!
Or should I say, President Kang?

86
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:57,424
Why are you here?
What about the inauguration?

87
00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:59,050
I heard you've been working hard.

88
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:01,011
Taking bribes from friends, relatives,

89
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,055
and even from your mistress
to sell contracts to be our partners.

90
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,809
Wait a second.
I think you've been hearing rumors.

91
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:09,436
You even hired a D-list celebrity

92
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,938
for the company ad
just because he's your nephew.

93
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,189
I saw it at the airport.

94
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,066
No, that's…

95
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:19,446
You must have thought it was okay
to take advantage of our company like that

96
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,907
since the chairman's turned
a blind eye to what you do.

97
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,707
President Kang, listen.
It's not like that.

98
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,794
I've been inattentive to company matters,
spending so much time abroad.

99
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:36,921
I intend to pay closer attention
from now on.

100
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,720
I'll see you tomorrow, then, Mr. Park.

101
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:48,808
Hey, President Kang!

102
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:50,602
Wait, President Kang!

103
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:52,145
President Kang.

104
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,315
Mr. Park! Are you okay?

105
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:56,691
-What is this?
-Damn it.

106
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:59,110
-What's going on?
-What is this?

107
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:20,715
Since it's Ms. Shin's birthday, I made
reservations at Auntie's Street Food

108
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:23,301
for our team dinner today.
Ms. Shin's favorite!

109
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:25,428
All right. How long has it been?

110
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,306
Oh, you guys didn't have to do that
just for my birthday.

111
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,599
Thank you.

112
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,602
What are you talking about?
A team's got to stick together.

113
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,645
You're buying, right?

114
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:35,814
Great!

115
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:38,608
<i>Happy birthday. Can you swing by?
I have something for you.</i>

116
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:45,865
Ms. Yeo, I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can make it to the team dinner today.

117
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:47,700
Why? What is it?

118
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:49,869
Is it a guy?

119
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:51,454
How did you know?

120
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:56,626
Because your soulless eyes
are suddenly sparkling. That's how.

121
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:58,878
Okay, go on.

122
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:03,925
It looks like we'll have to celebrate
Ms. Shin's birthday

123
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:05,510
without the birthday girl.

124
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,346
An inauguration without the president,

125
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,807
and a birthday party
without the birthday girl?

126
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,975
What's going on?

127
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,395
Seriously. This is like celebrating
Thanksgiving without a turkey.

128
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,773
I'm sorry.
I promise the next dinner is on me!

129
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:20,316
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,122
Hello?

131
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:35,415
Ha-ri!

132
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:38,793
I'm so busy, I can't even meet up
with you on your birthday.

133
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:40,378
So what's my girl got planned?

134
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:42,881
Min-woo wants to see me,
so I'm heading over.

135
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:44,340
One moment.

136
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,884
Min-woo?

137
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:47,760
Why is he calling you on your birthday?

138
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:50,221
After he made you
do all that work for his new menu?

139
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:53,808
That was hardly work.
I had a blast, and I learned a lot too.

140
00:08:53,892 --> 00:08:57,687
<i>Goodness, you're really head-over-heels
for Min-woo.</i>

141
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,773
But he's never been the type
to remember birthdays. Why is he--

142
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,110
Wait, no way!

143
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:05,111
No way, what?

144
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:07,489
Was that necklace from before
really your birthday gift?

145
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:08,615
Necklace?

146
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,127
Why is a woman's necklace here?

147
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,838
Maybe some customer left it behind.

148
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:27,383
There's even a certificate
of authenticity!

149
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:30,553
Look, this is garnet!

150
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:31,804
That's my birthstone.

151
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,640
Is he dating a girl born in January?

152
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:35,892
Remember that foreign model girl?

153
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,561
She went back to her country
after Min-woo rejected her.

154
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,731
Then is it that journalist
writing an article on his restaurant?

155
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,901
She was flirting with Min-woo
but stopped after he friendzoned her.

156
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:45,985
The YouTuber then!

157
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:48,404
That YouTuber?
She asked him out on a livestream.

158
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,740
And got rejected live. Right.

159
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:54,244
Maybe it's your birthday present.

160
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,037
You think? Let me see.

161
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,999
No, this is way too expensive
to buy for a friend.

162
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,709
-Right?
-Yeah.

163
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:16,933
<i>It has to be!</i>

164
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,310
That necklace really was for you!

165
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:22,063
You said that it was too expensive
to buy for a friend.

166
00:10:22,897 --> 00:10:24,524
Well, what if he's planning to transfer

167
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:26,985
from the friendship train
to the boyfriend express?

168
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:30,613
<i>If you are transferring to Train 6,
please exit at the next stop.</i>

169
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,907
<i>The exit is to the right.</i>

170
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,465
-Has the inauguration been taken care of?
-Yes, it went well.

171
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:52,802
What about the chairman?

172
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,476
You crazy bastard.

173
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,146
I told you to come to the inauguration.
You blow me off.

174
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,065
I told you to meet me at the house,
but you meet me at work.

175
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:08,359
You're determined to go against me,
aren't you?

176
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:10,903
Of course not. I've simply been too busy.

177
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:14,324
You just flew back in today!
You can't take a single damn day off?

178
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,785
No, I can't. There are too many things
that need to be taken care of.

179
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:19,454
What now?

180
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,708
Why the hell does Park keep on calling me?

181
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,668
What things need to be taken care of?

182
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:28,713
This is a well-oiled machine.
You're nitpicking.

183
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:31,549
You think you're
the only smart one in the world.

184
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:33,426
Are you realizing that now?

185
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:36,846
You know none of
my projects has failed, right?

186
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,973
Even the kimchi project
was a hit overseas.

187
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:41,893
Yes, I'm aware. That's actually why

188
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:46,731
I've prepared a very important
project for you.

189
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:49,317
What kind of project?

190
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,995
Marriage!

191
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,373
Are you getting married, sir?

192
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,291
Not me!

193
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,419
No, thank you.
I'm too young to get married.

194
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:11,130
But I'm not getting any younger, you know.

195
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:15,760
Is it too much to ask to see
my grandson with a wife?

196
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:18,262
Yes, it's too much. I'm not seeing anyone,

197
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:20,473
and I don't plan to anytime soon.

198
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:22,392
Besides, I have a lot of work to do.

199
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:27,688
That's why I've arranged
all the blind dates for you.

200
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:29,816
-What?
-I've put together a list

201
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:35,446
of 20 elite, single ladies
in the business world for you to meet.

202
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,657
All you have to do is show up.

203
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,699
Okay?

204
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,076
You made the list yourself?

205
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,828
Wow, that couldn't have been easy.

206
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:43,621
That's right, it wasn't easy.

207
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:45,248
If I had anyone else do it,

208
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,584
the entire finance sector
would be buzzing with rumors.

209
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,962
-So--
-You've wasted your time.

210
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:53,631
I won't ever go
on any of your arranged dates.

211
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:56,717
You little brat.
What am I going to do with you?

212
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,555
What is it?

213
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,808
ALARM 9:00 P.M.
TIME TO WATCH DRAMA

214
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:06,394
It's time already, huh?

215
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,981
It's already time.

00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:22,743
If you're just going to watch TV, go home.

223
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:26,831
Do you think I'm going to listen to you
when you don't listen to me?

224
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:28,958
I'll watch it here.

225
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:38,718
<i>It's been quite a while

a crush on him and is ready to accept?</i>

227
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:44,682
No way.

228
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:48,603
What? Why is it so dark?

229
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:55,818
Is Min-woo really--

230
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:01,407
Attention, please.
Min-woo is about to transfer

231
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:04,911
from the friendship train
to the boyfriend express.

232
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:15,505
What are you waiting for?
Run to him and give him a hug already!

233
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:18,674
Run!

234
00:14:25,306 --> 00:14:28,142
Min-woo.

235

What's her problem?

237
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,876
This is so annoying.

238
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,051
Yikes, I really messed that up for you,
didn't I?

239
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,554
It's okay.
I was doing it since they're regulars.

240
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,389
I just gave them the food for free.

241
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,231
Anyway, sorry. You must be busy.
I'll get going.

242
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:16,983
Wait a second.

243
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,531

They weren't easy to get, so make sure you
go with a guy and not with Young-seo.

249
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,015
Okay.

250
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,017
Go on.

251
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:59,317

Good going.

You're eating instant food
as your first meal back in Korea

254
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:13,289
when you know how to cook everything
from Korean to Western!

255
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:18,252
Wouldn't it be nice
to sit at the dinner table with your wife

256
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:20,463
and enjoy a good home-cooked meal?

257
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,632
I'm not getting married just for that.

258
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:26,385
I hear American women are beautiful.

259
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:30,056
Did you really not date at all?
I'm open-minded, you know.

260
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:32,934
I have no time for that.
I'm busy enough with work.

261
00:16:33,017 --> 00:16:37,104
That's why I've scheduled
your blind dates for you. So--

262
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:39,273
I told you I'm not interested, didn't I?

263
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:47,073
Are you two dating?

264
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:48,658
-What?
-What?

265
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,951
It seems that way.

266
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:52,745
You two are joined at the hip,
using work as an excuse.

267
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:54,622
I don't know about him, but I'm not gay.

268
00:16:54,705 --> 00:16:56,874
And even if I liked men,

269
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:01,837
-President Kang isn't really my style.
-Is that so? Not your style?

270
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,590
Hey, what do you mean?
What's wrong with me?

271
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:06,968
Fine. If you're not, you're not.

272
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:10,346
Then why are you
so against going on these dates?

273
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,768
What is it now?

274
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,770
ALARM 10 P.M.

Ah, shoot…

276
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:21,732
I can take care of myself,
so just go watch your TV shows.

277
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:23,192
Isn't that alarm for them?

278
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,569
It's for my blood pressure medication!

279
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:28,197
My blood pressure is so high nowadays
because of you.

280
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,408
I'm taking pills every day!

281
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:32,868
How is that my fault?
It runs in the family.

282
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,413
It'd be your fault
if I got high blood pressure.

288
00:17:50,094 --> 00:17:52,722
Hey, everyone, help yourselves.

289
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:54,140
Eat up, guys.

290
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:55,182
Okay.

291
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:57,059
-Cheers!
-Bottoms up!

292
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,686
Cheers!

293
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:13,451
-Sir, can I get some more of these chips?
-Go ahead.

294
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:15,578
-Mom!
-Gosh, what? You scared me!

295
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:19,749
I told you that you have to coat
the chicken properly to make it crispy.

296
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,334
I told you you have to be thorough.

297
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:24,128
But I am tossing it!

298
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:28,507
If we're not going to do things right,
we should just close up shop.

299
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:32,511
I guess that's why
the chicken Ha-ri makes tastes better.

300
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:33,429
You're the best!

301
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:38,642
Of course! She works at a major company,
after all. She's different.

302
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:41,437
Why are you so edgy today?

303
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:45,232
It can't feel great to have to work
on your birthday, of all days.

304
00:18:45,316 --> 00:18:48,444
So what? I'm the one
who gave birth after 20 hours of labor!

305
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:53,282
Toss and toss and toss…

306
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,703
Will he be all right?

307
00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:01,248
Yes. His blood pressure's higher
than usual, but it's not serious.

308
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:03,167
What do you mean, it's not serious?

309
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,711
Last time, you said that my lungs,

310
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:08,672
kidneys, and small intestine
weren't doing great.

311
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:09,757
What? I did?

312
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,759
Doctor!

313
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,845
Oh, yes, that's right. I remember now.

314
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,599
Considering his age,
things can change drastically day by day.

315
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:21,811
And you said I should avoid stress
more than anything, right?

316
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:22,728
Yes, sir.

317
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:25,940
-Everyone around him should be careful.
-Did you hear that?

318
00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:29,276
It seems you're fine,
so drop the act and get out of bed.

319
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,447
You! Do you really want
to see me die because of you?

320
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:34,824
I'm going to--

321
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,910
Since you're already here,
why don't you get a full checkup?

322
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:39,245
I'm leaving.

323
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:47,962
SEOUL KANGSUNG HOSPITAL

324
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,939
What's the point of group reservations?

325
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:09,108
You give them a discount,

326
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:11,193
and they just fill up on the free snacks.

327
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:17,366
Why has she been so grumpy all day?

328
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:19,702
Hey, Ha-ri.

329
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,455
Don't you have a boyfriend who can throw
you a birthday party or something?

330
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,916
I didn't leave anything in front of

331
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,501
-your store!
-What's going on?

332
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:29,461
I told you I saw it! This is yours!

333
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,463
You've got a big mouth for a kid!

334
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:32,506
-Yes, I do!
-What?

335
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,216
-Hey.
-What? What is it?

336
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,093
Why is this in front of our store?

337
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:37,595
I put it there for a minute

338
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:39,972
because a customer parked
in front of our store!

339
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:42,683
I know you put it here
whenever you get the chance.

340
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:43,976
Did you see me do it?

341
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,478
It's obvious!
We find fish bones all the time!

342
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:48,522
We don't sell fish! We sell chicken.

343
00:20:48,606 --> 00:20:50,608
-Take it.
-We don't sell fish either.

344
00:20:50,691 --> 00:20:53,611
It says it right there.
"Fish, dried fish, mackerel, so on."

345
00:20:53,694 --> 00:20:54,653
-Take it.
-Honey, come on.

346
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:58,032
We're all neighbors here. There's no need
to fight. Let's talk it out.

347
00:20:58,115 --> 00:21:01,202
-I'm doing this so we don't have to fight.
-Come on, take it!

348
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:04,371
This is a new shirt!
I had it shipped from abroad!

349
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:08,167
-You toss it! Do what you want with it!
-Hey, don't shove it at him!

350
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:10,211
I didn't…

351
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:15,382
You were the one who started it!

352
00:21:16,634 --> 00:21:17,468
Get in here.

353
00:21:20,721 --> 00:21:24,558
Man, breaking the neighbor's store sign
and everything…

354
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:26,352
I feel so bad.

355
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:29,605
Everyone in the Shin family
has such a temper!

356
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:33,692
As if it wasn't enough that Ha-min
started fighting, why did you do that?

357
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:35,986
I got this temper from you, Mom.

358
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,073
Yes, why are you blaming it on the Shins?

359
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:41,742
What? Since when did you two
get along so well?

360
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:44,787
You guys just have to
talk back like that, don't you?

361
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,414
It's because I take after you, Mom!

362
00:21:47,957 --> 00:21:49,291
It's my birthday!

363
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:51,335
Why are you hitting me?

364
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,172
You can't keep on using that as an excuse!

365
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:00,761
I made you seaweed soup in the morning!
Isn't that enough?

366
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,349
You forgot to cook her seaweed soup today.

367
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,851
Just stop it.

368
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:20,656
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HA-RI
FROM MIN-WOO

369
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:26,870
<i>Happy birthday, Ha-ri.</i>

370
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:29,623
<i>Tickets to your favorite singer's concert.</i>

371
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:33,293
<i>They weren't easy to get, so make sure you
go with a guy and not with Young-seo.</i>

372
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:58,110
Fine. I said, fine.

373
00:22:59,737 --> 00:23:02,031
Did you have a good night's sleep?

374
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,170
-I have something to tell you.
-I just got a call from Mr. Park.

375
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:19,048
So you're aware of the situation?
I'm going to fire Mr. Park.

376
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,966
What? Says who?

377
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:24,219
He selected the subcontractors illegally.

378
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:29,641
But he still did a lot for the company
working under your predecessor.

379
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:31,769
He built a summer house
on our company land.

380
00:23:31,852 --> 00:23:34,938
And he used our employees
for his personal affairs.

381
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:37,483
He'll do it all over again
if we let him be.

382
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,364
Park's father is Sang-gu,

383
00:23:44,448 --> 00:23:49,620
my good old friend who contributed
greatly to our company's success.

384
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:52,664
He asked me to take care
of his son for him when he passed--

385
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:55,793
You can take care of him personally
after letting him go.

386
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:57,086
Come on.

387
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,797
Then,

388
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:02,424
do me a favor in return.

389
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:04,927
Go on the dates!

390
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,057
-Grandfather, that's--
-Stop making excuses and just do it.

391
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,102
I'm breaking the promise
I made to my dead friend.

392
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,938
It's the least you could do.

393
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,446
Fine, I'll go on the dates.

394
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,324
You mean it? Really?

395
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:29,201
Ms. Ahn, you heard it too, right?

396
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:31,370
-Yes, sir.
-You're my witness, okay?

397
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:32,579
All right.

398
00:24:33,163 --> 00:24:35,958
Ha-ri, why did you have to go
and lose your temper?

399
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,710
Wait, the total is 800,000 won…

400
00:24:38,794 --> 00:24:43,423
My tiny monthly pay minus
money for my savings, work loan,

401
00:24:43,507 --> 00:24:46,635
and spending money…
I barely have anything left.

402
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:50,764
Where am I going to get 800,000 won?

403
00:24:54,935 --> 00:24:56,311
-Did you hear?
-Oh, my God!

404
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:59,231
You don't know?
I'm the only one who's heard?

405
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:01,150
Don't freak out, okay?

406
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,402
Mr. Park got fired.

407
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:05,487
-What?
-Are you sure you heard right?

408
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:08,115
He's one of the chairman's men,
but he got fired?

409
00:25:08,198 --> 00:25:09,449
Why did they fire him?

410
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:12,661
Apparently, he's been accepting bribes
from the subcontractors.

411
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:16,498
I heard President Kang is really strict.
So it's true.

412
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,083
I know, right?

413
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:20,794
You guys don't seem shocked, though.

414
00:25:26,175 --> 00:25:27,301
Hi, Young-seo.

415
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:34,266
So you got ahead of yourself and ended up
completely ruining somebody's event.

416
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:37,311
Hey, you're partially responsible.
You put ideas into my head.

417
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:38,395
INCOMING CALL
BIOLOGICAL FATHER

418
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:42,399
"Biological father"?
Did you fight with your dad again?

419
00:25:42,482 --> 00:25:44,484
When were we ever on good terms?

420
00:25:44,568 --> 00:25:46,195
Why is he calling me at this hour?

421
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:56,163
How could he tell me
about a blind date on the day of?

422
00:25:56,246 --> 00:25:57,080
MANNA SNACK BAR

423
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:59,333
But I thought blind dates
were off the table

424
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:01,835
after you faked that exorcism
on your last one.

425
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,420
You're still getting offers?

426
00:26:03,503 --> 00:26:07,132
I suppose the rumors didn't spread
as much as I had thought.

427
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:09,551
Damn it!

428
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:13,472
Wait for me.

429
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,933
So, who is it this time?
Is it the Dongseong Group?

430
00:26:16,516 --> 00:26:17,684
Daemin Group?

431
00:26:17,768 --> 00:26:20,270
I don't know. I didn't even ask.

432
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,357
I'm so busy with work already.

433
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:27,319
Rather than getting wrinkles
from working overtime,

434
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:31,365
isn't going on a blind date
with a wealthy guy more productive?

435
00:26:31,448 --> 00:26:36,119
No, I'm never doing an arranged marriage.

436
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:40,040
I'm only going to marry out of love
with someone I meet through fate.

437
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:43,669
You're so spoiled,
talking about fate and all that.

438
00:26:45,045 --> 00:26:46,213
So I was thinking.

439
00:26:46,797 --> 00:26:48,882
I'm going to need your help again.

440
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:52,844
Hey, I told you I'd stop doing that
once I got a job.

441
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:54,137
I'll pass.

442
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:57,766
This is the last time, I swear!

443
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:01,228
Can't you just pretend
to be possessed just one more time

444
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:03,730
so I can stop going on
these blind dates for good?

445
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,116
You must be nervous.
You haven't said a word.

446
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,662
-What's wrong, Young-seo?
-No.

447
00:27:18,745 --> 00:27:21,456
-No.
-Young-seo, are you all right?

448
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,708
Let go!

449
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:28,171
Do you have any idea
who you're addressing?

450
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:33,010
How dare you approach the noble host

451
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:36,179
of the spirit of the great general,
you filthy mortal?

452
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:37,764
Spirit of the great general?

453
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:40,183
What's that?

454
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:44,062
What the hell are you doing?

455
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:45,814
-What's gotten into you?
-Stay still.

456
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,108
If you value your life, stay still.

457
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:54,865
What have you done to make such a vengeful
maiden spirit attach herself to you?

458
00:28:03,457 --> 00:28:05,584
Am I the only one who can see the ghost--

459
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:10,255
<i>I looked up the heir of Daepoong Group,
and he was a huge playboy.</i>

460
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:14,551
<i>So I tossed in the maiden spirit part.
He was so terrified.</i>

461
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,348
That's what I'm talking about.

462
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:21,975
Can you help me out again? Please?

463
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:23,644
No, do it yourself.

464
00:28:24,227 --> 00:28:27,939
Come on,
my acting will only get me so far.

465
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,025
Help me.

466
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:34,488
No. I'm uncomfortable
with so many people knowing my face.

467
00:28:35,405 --> 00:28:36,823
I'll pay you.

468
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,620
What? Tonight at seven?

469
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:44,206
Yes, sir. At the coffee shop
at the Imperial Hotel.

470
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,166
With Jin Young-seo from the Marine Group.

471
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:49,252
I have a full schedule today.
Tell them I'm busy.

472
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:55,008
<i>I don't want to hear you say anything
about being too busy.</i>

473
00:28:55,092 --> 00:28:58,136
<i>Sung-hoon, move some things around
and make the time.</i>

474
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,098
<i>This is exactly why I pay you so much.</i>

475
00:29:01,682 --> 00:29:04,685
And that's why I went ahead
and cleared your schedule.

476
00:29:04,768 --> 00:29:06,812
It was easier at the overseas branch.

477
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:10,607
I hope you find a suitable partner
among the top ten candidates.

478
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:12,109
Why is that?

479
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:14,569
Number 11 is in Japan
and 17 is in Switzerland.

480
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:16,822
Do you want to travel
that far for a blind date?

481
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:17,989
What?

482
00:29:18,073 --> 00:29:20,575
Or just get married
like the chairman wants.

483
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,495
Then I won't have to bother
with making time in your schedule

484
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:26,039
and you won't
have to waste any more time--

485
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:28,458
I'm just frustrated, that's all.

486
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:32,170
I mean, I get where
the chairman is coming from.

487
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:33,505
No.

488
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,966
I think it's a good idea.

489
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:39,678
Marriage.

490
00:29:48,562 --> 00:29:50,272
Hello.

491
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,858
We're going for a tough girl concept

492
00:29:52,941 --> 00:29:55,235
for Marine Beauty's new product line.

493
00:29:55,318 --> 00:29:57,863
Let's pick the clothes you'll wear
to the blind date here.

494
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:03,368
Okay.

495
00:30:03,452 --> 00:30:05,996
Something lacey like this
will look super intimidating.

496
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:12,836
Or a leather belt like this
to make a bold statement.

497
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,505
That looks tough! Let's go with this.

498
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:23,430
-Maybe I should be showing more skin?
-Yeah. Let's try on something else.

499
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,475
-No.
-No.

500
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:27,642
This?

501
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,352
Hey, you're doing this on purpose!

502
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,938
-That one's really not it.
-I'm cold.

503
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:34,983
That's the point.
It makes you look like you're crazy.

504
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:38,195
-I will not…
-Marry you!

505
00:30:38,695 --> 00:30:40,280
You're like a cute little fox.

506
00:30:57,672 --> 00:31:00,008
Bravo! Perfect.

507
00:31:00,717 --> 00:31:02,093
You're so pretty.

508
00:31:11,144 --> 00:31:15,273
<i>The play has started, and now it's time
to flex your acting chops, Ha-ri.</i>

509
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:17,359
<i>No, wait.</i>

510
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:20,028
<i>I'm Young-seo now.</i>

511
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,198
<i>Jin Young-seo.</i>

512
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:26,201
Ms. Jin Young-seo?

513
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,369
Yes.

514
00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:34,709
<i>What? Why is he so good-looking?</i>

515
00:31:35,335 --> 00:31:36,211
<i>He's hot.</i>

516
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,504
You are Ms. Jin, right?

517
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:39,130
Yes.

518
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:41,967
Please have a seat.

519
00:31:58,942 --> 00:32:02,153
<i>I wish I could take my time
appreciating his looks.</i>

520
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:05,156
<i>But I need to end things quickly. Right.</i>

521
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:07,868
<i>Why don't I start by being rude?</i>

522
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:13,206
I don't even know who you are.

523
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,165
Your name is?

524
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:19,963
My name is Kang Tae-moo.

525
00:32:20,046 --> 00:32:21,464
What? Kang, what?

526
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:22,424
Kang Tae-moo.

527
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,800
"Kang Tae-moo"?

528
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:25,719
Oops.

529
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,348
Kang Tae-moo.

530
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,977
<i>Kang Tae-moo?</i>

531
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:37,022
<i>The president of our company,
Kang Tae-moo?</i>

532
00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:43,904
Ms. Jin?

533
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:46,740
-Ms. Jin!
-Yes?

534
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:48,950
Is something wrong?

535
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:52,537
No. Not at all.

536
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:55,749
I need to pop to the bathroom.

537
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,881
Excuse me, where's the bathroom?
Over there? Okay.

538
00:33:02,964 --> 00:33:05,926
Young-seo, please pick up, please!

539
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:08,136
<i>Please leave your message after the tone.</i>

540
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,804
Young-seo, you crazy wench!

541
00:33:12,307 --> 00:33:13,767
This is ridiculous.

542
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:16,436
Right!

543
00:33:17,187 --> 00:33:19,481
Let's run! I can just run away.

544
00:33:28,031 --> 00:33:31,660
<i>I just need to stay calm
and do what needs to be done.</i>

545
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,788
<i>There's 800,000 won on the line!
You can do this, Ha--</i>

546
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:36,665
<i>I mean, Young-seo.</i>

547
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,500
Please.

548
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:40,919
Sure.

549
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:45,799
<i>Don't be so nervous.</i>

550
00:33:45,882 --> 00:33:49,427
<i>This guy doesn't know I'm Ha-ri,
an employee at his company.</i>

551
00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:51,721
<i>He thinks I'm Young-seo from Marine Group.</i>

552
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:57,936
It's so hot.

553
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:00,522
It's a bit hot in here, isn't it?

554
00:34:06,736 --> 00:34:09,364
<i>No man likes a woman
who reveals too much skin.</i>

555
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,323
Aren't you cold?

556
00:34:10,407 --> 00:34:12,826
Cold? No, this is perfect.

557
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,955
My body runs a bit hot, you see.

558
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,751
You have goosebumps all over your arm.

559
00:34:21,835 --> 00:34:23,086
<i>Crap.</i>

560
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,215
I just get goosebumps a lot, you know.

561
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:28,842
<i>On to the next step.</i>

562
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:31,011
Oh, sorry!

563
00:34:31,553 --> 00:34:36,266
Baby, did I scare you?
You took a little bump? It's okay!

564
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:39,310
Did you get startled too? My babies!

565
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:43,940
<i>A woman crazy about luxury goods.
How's that for a turn-off--</i>

566
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:46,317
What are you doing?

567
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:50,613
Sorry, it was a text from work.

568
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:51,990
You were saying?

569
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:54,200
<i>This won't do. On to my last resort.</i>

570
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:56,953
-I'm so sad.
-What?

571
00:34:57,037 --> 00:35:00,874
I'm sad. You being so uninterested in me

572
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:03,960
makes Samantha and Rachel really sad.

573
00:35:04,544 --> 00:35:06,254
Samantha and Rachel?

574
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,547
Yes.

575
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:16,806
The one on the left is Samantha,
and the one on the right is Rachel.

576
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,185
I spent a whopping ten million won a piece
on these babies.

577
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:22,020
Hi!

578
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:24,481
<i>I bet you've never met anyone
as crazy as this before.</i>

579
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:29,736
I'm rambling, aren't I?

580
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,155
Oh, my.

581
00:35:33,615 --> 00:35:34,449
No.

582
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:39,162
I prefer an honest person like you
over a hypocrite who lies.

583
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:40,663
-<i>What?</i>
-What?

584
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:42,082
<i>Why is he so positive?</i>

585
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:47,629
<i>This won't work.
I need to bring out the big guns.</i>

586
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:56,554
Really? You really like me?

587
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:58,014
Oh, my.

588
00:35:58,098 --> 00:35:59,307
Then should we…

589
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:02,310
get a room?

590
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:13,947
A room?

591
00:36:14,614 --> 00:36:19,410
Yes, so that we can really
get down to business.

592
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:23,456
<i>How's that?</i>

593
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,293
<i>There's no way that you'll like a woman
who wants to get a room on the first date.</i>

594
00:36:27,377 --> 00:36:30,421
<i>No way…</i>

595
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:41,099
Let's go.

596
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:42,183
Okay.

597
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,352
Okay.

598
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:56,573
<i>What is this?</i>

599
00:36:57,407 --> 00:36:59,576
<i>What'll happen
if I just follow him into that room?</i>

600
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:06,708
<i>Let's run! The money's not worth it!</i>

601
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:10,628
Oh! I'm sorry.

602
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,548
Where do you think you're going?

603
00:37:14,591 --> 00:37:15,633
What are you doing?

604
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:17,760
What? You have no idea who I am, do you?

605
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:20,638
Wait, let go of me first. Who are you?

606
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:23,183
I'm Min-sik's girlfriend.

607
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:25,727
Who is Min-sik…

608
00:37:27,437 --> 00:37:30,356
What are you doing?
Let go of her. Let's talk it out.

609
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,278
I think this woman's crazy.

610
00:37:35,361 --> 00:37:38,156
You were in a room here
with Min-sik just an hour ago,

611
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,491
and now you're getting a room
with another guy?

612
00:37:40,575 --> 00:37:42,118
What a piece of trash.

613
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:45,288
What are you talking about?
I don't even know who Min-sik is.

614
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:47,123
So you're going to play dumb?

615
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,584
Isn't this you?

616
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:52,295
This…

617
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:54,797
Why, that--

618
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:56,883
She does look similar, but…

619
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:01,054
Okay, she and I look similar, but…

620
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:03,264
I'm sorry, but long hair is a common look.

621
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:06,726
And these clothes are new this season,
so many people wear them.

622
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:08,019
Anyway, that's not me.

623
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:09,938
So you're going to keep lying.

624
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:12,982
You little--

625
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:16,986
Why don't you go get
your boyfriend under control?

626
00:38:17,654 --> 00:38:20,907
It takes two to cheat,
it's not something she did on her own.

627
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:22,867
Let's go.

628
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:30,333
Those bastards!

629
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:35,755
Mr. Cha, where are you?
I just came out of the lobby.

630
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:38,424
Okay.

631
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:45,098
<i>What the hell? I've just become
some crazy, cheating bitch.</i>

632
00:38:45,181 --> 00:38:46,933
<i>This is so embarrassing.</i>

633
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,728
<i>No. Maybe this is for the better.</i>

634
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,982
It takes two to cheat?

635
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:57,318
How dare you accuse me of two-timing?

636
00:38:57,402 --> 00:39:00,655
-Are you saying it's a misunderstanding?
-Yes. Two-timing?

637
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:02,907
I've never done that in my life.

638
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:06,286
Though I have seen three
or four guys at the same time.

639
00:39:08,037 --> 00:39:11,082
-What?
-I really like men.

640
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:15,712
I know you like honesty,
but this is a bit much, right?

641
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:16,796
Hey!

642
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:18,715
Stop right there!

643
00:39:19,382 --> 00:39:21,843
I'm going to leave
before anything worse happens to me.

644
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,678
Bye!

645
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:26,681
Hey, wait--

646
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:32,562
I'm sorry.

647
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:34,314
What…

648
00:39:38,818 --> 00:39:42,572
Stop, you bitch!

649
00:39:46,868 --> 00:39:47,869
Mr. Kang.

650
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:48,953
Let's just go.

651
00:39:49,037 --> 00:39:51,497
Didn't you say you were
driving Ms. Jin home?

652
00:39:52,206 --> 00:39:54,459
-She's over there, leaving.
-Pardon?

653
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:58,379
Stop right there, you bitch!

654
00:40:01,558 --> 00:40:04,644
So she got caught
having an affair and ran?

655
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:07,063
Yes. She said she really likes men

656
00:40:07,147 --> 00:40:09,607
and that she sees
three to four guys at a time.

657
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:12,443
She sounds like the worst.

658
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:18,241
What else? Samantha and Rachel?

659
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:21,244
-What does that mean?
-Don't ask.

660
00:40:21,327 --> 00:40:24,080
-Sounds like it was a big waste of time.
-Maybe.

661
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:30,712
Yes.

662
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:33,464
We just said bye, and I'm heading home.

663
00:40:33,548 --> 00:40:35,008
The date's over already?

664
00:40:35,842 --> 00:40:37,260
Sounds like it didn't work out.

665
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:40,847
Fine, let me talk to Sung-hoon.

666
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,891
So we can schedule the next date.

667
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,142
There's no need for that.

668
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:45,268
What?

669
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:48,271
You're going to break your promise
and stop going on these dates?

670
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:49,564
No.

671
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:52,859
I'm going to marry Ms. Jin Young-seo,
the lady I met tonight.

672
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,862
You, what?

673
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:06,247
How on earth could the blind date
be the president of your company?

674
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,792
So? How did it go?

675
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:11,252
How do you think it went?

676
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:16,299
I just did my job!

677
00:41:16,382 --> 00:41:17,759
Oh, come on!

678
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,595
I used all the personalities
that guys hate,

679
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,847
so I'm sure he won't contact you again.

680
00:41:23,723 --> 00:41:26,976
Thank you for completing the mission
even in a situation like that.

681
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,686
You're a true friend.

682
00:41:30,939 --> 00:41:32,607
To partners in crime?

683
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,234
Yes, of course.

684
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:35,526
I'm so proud of you.

685
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:39,405
You've worked hard,
so I'll get the next round of drinks too.

686
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:43,034
Thanks.

687
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:47,330
<i>I'm the only one who can see him</i>

688
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,084
Hey! Why do you keep
ending my songs early?

689
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,627
It's depressing!

690
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,463
You're just adding more stress,
not relieving it.

691
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,590
Ballads relieve stress better.

692
00:41:57,674 --> 00:41:59,634
By expressing how it feels to love--

693
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,346
I'm not doing it.

694
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,904
One, two, three, go!

695
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:23,074
<i>I want to tell you
Even though you can only hear me</i>

696
00:42:23,157 --> 00:42:27,495
<i>After the sad times have passed</i>

697
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:33,251
<i>Close your eyes and feel my heart</i>

698
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:36,170
<i>And my eyes looking toward you</i>

699
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:41,092
<i>I love you, just like this feeling</i>

700
00:42:41,175 --> 00:42:45,430
<i>This is the end of the wandering
That I have dreamed of</i>

701
00:42:45,513 --> 00:42:47,432
<i>It keeps repeating in this world</i>

702
00:42:47,515 --> 00:42:50,059
Dad? Is he calling about the blind date?

703
00:42:53,855 --> 00:42:54,856
Yes, Dad?

704
00:43:01,863 --> 00:43:03,239
I got 100 points?

705
00:43:03,323 --> 00:43:08,578
I got 100 points! Yes! 100 points!

706
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:10,288
I got 100 points!

707
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:12,498
Young-seo, I got a 100!

708
00:43:12,582 --> 00:43:15,001
I got 100 points!

709
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:17,170
Ha-ri,

710
00:43:17,253 --> 00:43:19,088
what did you do?

711
00:43:19,172 --> 00:43:22,800
What do you mean? I sang my heart out!

712
00:43:22,884 --> 00:43:24,344
Not that!

713
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,599
What did you do to make
President Kang want to marry me?

714
00:43:29,682 --> 00:43:32,185
What? He wants to marry you?

715
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,146
Not me, you.

716
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:40,860
You're the one who went on the blind date.
Tell me what happened!

717
00:43:40,943 --> 00:43:43,029
Ha-ri!

718
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:44,864
What?

719
00:43:45,698 --> 00:43:48,284
<i>Are you really going
to marry Ms. Jin Young-seo?</i>

720
00:43:48,368 --> 00:43:51,662
-Yes, how many times do you have to ask?
-I just find it hard to believe.

721
00:43:51,746 --> 00:43:53,081
She two-timed--

722
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:55,500
To marry a woman who dates
as many men as she likes?

723
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,502
Why is her past any problem?

724
00:43:57,585 --> 00:44:00,505
Because I feel like it will be a problem
even after getting married.

725
00:44:00,588 --> 00:44:02,673
I mean, she seemed like quite the woman.

726
00:44:02,757 --> 00:44:04,550
Of course she is.
She's from the Marine Group.

727
00:44:04,634 --> 00:44:08,137
Like Grandfather said, she'll be
a good asset for me. Should I let her go?

728
00:44:08,221 --> 00:44:10,807
Still, you should marry someone
that you love--

729
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,850
Love? What is love?

730
00:44:13,434 --> 00:44:16,562
You miss them
even when they're right there with you,

731
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,316
and your heart flutters
when you think about them.

732
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:22,777
I don't want to cling to mere emotion.

733
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,154
And wasting time
on blind dates is even worse.

734
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:27,824
Besides, I like Ms. Jin.

735
00:44:29,492 --> 00:44:31,828
She's very open and honest.

736
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:38,417
Come on, fold them right.
You keep messing it up.

737
00:44:39,502 --> 00:44:43,172
That wasn't me.
Those are the ones Ha-min made.

738
00:44:44,674 --> 00:44:48,052
Come on. I'm good at folding.

739
00:44:48,761 --> 00:44:50,555
I gave up on soccer as a kid,

740
00:44:50,638 --> 00:44:52,890
gave up becoming a celebrity
in middle school,

741
00:44:52,974 --> 00:44:55,101
and gave up studying in high school too.

742
00:44:55,184 --> 00:44:56,269
Good for you!

743
00:45:03,276 --> 00:45:06,362
I heard you gave the guy money
for his store sign and hospital bills.

744
00:45:06,445 --> 00:45:10,366
-Where did you get the money?
-I got a bonus from work.

745
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:14,370
Didn't you say things at work were weird
because of the new president?

746
00:45:14,453 --> 00:45:16,539
But he handed out bonuses right away?

747
00:45:16,622 --> 00:45:18,291
He seems pretty cool.

748
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,794
Did you see him? Didn't you say
he's the chairman's grandson?

749
00:45:21,878 --> 00:45:23,629
-What does he look like?
-I don't know.

750
00:45:23,713 --> 00:45:26,382
-Is he handsome?
-I don't know!

751
00:45:26,465 --> 00:45:28,759
Why are you asking me? Don't ask!

752
00:45:29,343 --> 00:45:30,344
Goodness.

753
00:45:31,387 --> 00:45:33,598
Why are you throwing a fit?

754
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:35,725
Who else would I ask?

755
00:45:35,808 --> 00:45:38,144
She put on a show to stop folding boxes.

756
00:45:38,227 --> 00:45:39,979
Hey, Ha-ri, get your butt back here.

757
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:42,940
She must be tired. Let her rest.

758
00:45:43,024 --> 00:45:45,318
I'll fold the boxes twice as fast.

759
00:45:45,401 --> 00:45:47,445
-Make that three times.
-Okay!

760
00:45:58,039 --> 00:45:59,707
Hello?

761
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,461
I'm hiding out in a hotel right now
because of you, my friend.

762
00:46:03,544 --> 00:46:04,587
<i>Why a hotel?</i>

763
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,173
Ever since President Kang
said he wanted to marry me,

764
00:46:07,256 --> 00:46:10,760
my old man's been trying to get
our families to meet up! So I ran!

765
00:46:11,886 --> 00:46:13,054
What are you going to do?

766
00:46:13,888 --> 00:46:16,224
You'd better clean up your mess.

767
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:17,725
How is this my fault?

768
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:21,771
If he wants to marry you
even after the crazy act I pulled,

769
00:46:21,854 --> 00:46:24,023
I'm sure he's after your family.

770
00:46:25,107 --> 00:46:25,983
You think so?

771
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:29,111
People who have it all are
always the ones who want more.

772
00:46:29,195 --> 00:46:31,614
His family's much wealthier than mine.

773
00:46:31,697 --> 00:46:33,991
I told you we should go
with the exorcism stuff.

774
00:46:34,075 --> 00:46:38,162
I'll bet my right hand and empty wallet
that he still would've wanted to marry you

775
00:46:38,246 --> 00:46:40,623
even if we went all out with an exorcism.

776
00:46:40,706 --> 00:46:42,833
So what do I do now?

777
00:46:43,918 --> 00:46:45,336
Should I run away from home?

778
00:46:45,419 --> 00:46:47,255
Or shave my head and become a monk?

779
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:49,757
Just meet President Kang
and tell him honestly.

780
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,927
Tell him that the woman he wants
to marry isn't Jin Young-seo,

781
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,264
that you sent someone else
to ruin the blind date.

782
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:59,892
Damn it, my dad is going to be so mad.

783
00:46:59,976 --> 00:47:02,436
But it'll stop all of this talk
about marriage.

784
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:08,109
Just look on the bright side.
It's like a blessing in disguise.

785
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:12,071
Wait, what if I run
into President Kang at work?

786
00:47:12,154 --> 00:47:13,447
Dang.

787
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:15,783
I'm getting goosebumps.

788
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:16,742
<i>Hey.</i>

789
00:47:16,826 --> 00:47:20,329
A regular employee will never
run into the president at work.

790
00:47:20,413 --> 00:47:22,081
-<i>Don't worry about it.</i>
-You think so?

791
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:24,625
Oh, wait.

792
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,135
Wait for me!

793
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:39,307
Damn it! Mr. Gye always gives me hell
if I arrive later than he does.

794
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,447
-Get in, miss.
-Pardon?

795
00:47:56,657 --> 00:47:58,826
There's a lot of space, so hop in.

796
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:04,540
Are you getting in or not?

797
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,712
Well, I…

798
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:17,845
<i>"A regular employee will never
run into the president at work"?</i>

799
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,305
<i>Whatever.</i>

800
00:48:19,388 --> 00:48:22,600
Mr. Chairman, what brings you
to the office this early in the morning?

801
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,686
It's my company. Am I not allowed to come?

802
00:48:26,395 --> 00:48:28,731
This brat made
a shocking declaration yesterday

803
00:48:28,814 --> 00:48:31,525
but didn't explain it,
so I followed him here.

804
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:34,445
What is there to explain?
I told you everything yesterday.

805
00:48:34,528 --> 00:48:37,365
So you're really going to marry her?

806
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:40,117
Sir, let's discuss that upstairs.

807
00:48:50,586 --> 00:48:51,629
You there.

808
00:48:55,091 --> 00:48:56,300
SENIOR RESEARCHER
SHIN HA-RI

809
00:48:56,384 --> 00:48:57,468
Ms. Shin Ha-ri?

810
00:48:57,551 --> 00:48:59,845
<i>What? Why is he calling me?</i>

811
00:48:59,929 --> 00:49:03,349
<i>No, wait, how does he even know my name?</i>

812
00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:07,603
Yes?

813
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,231
You dropped your employee ID.

814
00:49:11,357 --> 00:49:14,276
I see. Why did I drop that?

815
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:20,908
Can you give it…

816
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,701
Oh, thank you.

817
00:49:24,203 --> 00:49:25,871
<i>Doors closing.</i>

818
00:49:28,457 --> 00:49:29,375
Shin Ha-ri?

819
00:49:33,629 --> 00:49:37,675
Are you really going to marry Young-seo?

820
00:49:37,758 --> 00:49:39,093
Shin Ha-ri.

821
00:49:39,718 --> 00:49:40,761
Shin Ha-ri?

822
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,056
Shin Ha-ri.

823
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,934
EMPLOYEE PERSONAL RECORDS

824
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,185
I was right.

825
00:49:48,811 --> 00:49:50,855
What do you mean, you were right?

826
00:49:50,938 --> 00:49:52,273
That employee back there.

827
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,275
She made the proposal
for Bucket List Fish.

828
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,985
Oh, really?

829
00:49:56,485 --> 00:49:59,613
She's the one you singled out
for coming up with the idea, right?

830
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,490
I remembered her
because her name was unique.

831
00:50:01,574 --> 00:50:03,868
I thought she was quite competent.

832
00:50:04,452 --> 00:50:07,413
-Even aside from the Bucket List Fish--
-Stop talking about work!

833
00:50:08,414 --> 00:50:09,748
What's the big idea?

834
00:50:09,832 --> 00:50:11,167
What do you mean?

835
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,086
You always said blind dates
were a waste of time.

836
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,840
And now you want to get married
after one blind date?

837
00:50:17,923 --> 00:50:20,843
I'm giving you that granddaughter-in-law
you want so badly.

838
00:50:20,926 --> 00:50:22,261
Really?

839
00:50:22,344 --> 00:50:24,763
Does Young-seo want to marry you as well?

840
00:50:29,101 --> 00:50:30,311
What do you think?

841
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:32,730
About what?

842
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:37,943
With my face, body, impeccable manners,
and flawless personality,

843
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:40,237
why would she say no?

844
00:50:40,321 --> 00:50:43,324
You're right! No one would say no

845
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,284
to my handsome grandson!

846
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:47,745
Look at you.

847
00:50:50,372 --> 00:50:52,082
Who would say no to you?

848
00:50:53,834 --> 00:50:55,794
That's my boy.

849
00:50:56,462 --> 00:51:00,466
Was Young-seo really that good?

850
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,512
I'm not sure, sir.
I didn't get a good look at her.

851
00:51:06,972 --> 00:51:10,976
He lost his parents at a young age

852
00:51:11,477 --> 00:51:12,686
and I was

853
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:18,651
always too busy to really be there
for him as his grandfather.

854
00:51:19,235 --> 00:51:22,321
How nice would it be

855
00:51:22,905 --> 00:51:27,284
for him to start his own family
and love and care for them?

856
00:51:28,994 --> 00:51:31,413
This goes for you, too.

857
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:34,083
Aren't you going to get a girlfriend?

858
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:38,087
Don't just work all the time
like my grandson.

859
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:42,716
Go find a good girl for yourself
and introduce her to me.

860
00:51:44,718 --> 00:51:45,803
Okay?

861
00:51:47,763 --> 00:51:50,391
You ran into the president?
And in the elevator, of all places?

862
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,977
Yeah! Do you have any idea
how scared I was?

863
00:51:53,769 --> 00:51:58,190
So meet with Mr. Kang as soon as possible
and take care of this situation!

864
00:51:58,274 --> 00:52:01,986
Okay, fine. Don't worry.

865
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:03,153
Okay.

866
00:52:03,737 --> 00:52:05,239
Things are not looking good.

867
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:07,908
Are you okay?

868
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:09,910
I told you not to fool around!

869
00:52:09,994 --> 00:52:11,203
Oh, I'm so sorry.

870
00:52:16,792 --> 00:52:17,793
Hey, kid.

871
00:52:18,877 --> 00:52:21,130
Is it okay to run around
with something like this?

872
00:52:23,632 --> 00:52:24,925
Not okay, right?

873
00:52:25,634 --> 00:52:28,887
If you promise not to do it again,
I'll show you a magic trick.

874
00:52:28,971 --> 00:52:29,847
Promise.

875
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:33,058
Look.

876
00:52:38,439 --> 00:52:39,607
Ta-da!

877
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,442
-Guess what this is.
-Poop?

878
00:52:42,484 --> 00:52:43,319
Poop?

879
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:46,614
How does this look like poop?
It's a flower.

880
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:50,034
Here's the bud,
and right here are the leaves.

881
00:52:51,827 --> 00:52:53,829
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is,

882
00:52:53,912 --> 00:52:56,540
you can't be running around
with things like this.

883
00:52:56,624 --> 00:52:58,584
Somebody might get hurt,

884
00:52:58,667 --> 00:53:01,462
or you might ruin somebody's outfit
that's worth a fortune, okay?

885
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,130
-Okay.
-Good.

886
00:53:04,006 --> 00:53:05,758
Let me pay you for the dry cleaning.

887
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:09,928
Oh, it's fine. I scribbled more
than he did anyway. Here you go.

888
00:53:11,138 --> 00:53:12,222
Bye.

889
00:53:22,775 --> 00:53:25,611
Oh, right! My car keys and wallet.

890
00:53:29,323 --> 00:53:30,366
Oh, I'm sorry.

891
00:53:33,994 --> 00:53:35,204
Are you all right?

892
00:53:52,805 --> 00:53:54,556
<i>He's handsome as hell.</i>

893
00:53:57,976 --> 00:54:00,229
<i>He's absolutely gorgeous.</i>

894
00:54:01,188 --> 00:54:03,482
<i>I've found my love.</i>

895
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:11,156
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

896
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,282
It's no problem.

897
00:54:21,917 --> 00:54:26,088
I want to ask for his number so badly!

898
00:54:29,049 --> 00:54:29,925
Who is this?

899
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:32,970
Hello?

900
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:35,222
What? President Kang wants to meet you?

901
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,307
Yeah, he just called me.

902
00:54:37,391 --> 00:54:39,727
That's great!
You can meet and tell him the truth!

903
00:54:41,061 --> 00:54:44,982
My dear friend,
could you go instead of me?

904
00:54:45,065 --> 00:54:46,734
You must be crazy.

905
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:48,652
I have an important meeting.

906
00:54:48,736 --> 00:54:51,321
Still. How can I go instead? No way.

907
00:54:51,405 --> 00:54:52,489
What if I get caught?

908
00:54:52,573 --> 00:54:53,741
Why would you get caught?

909
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:56,118
Just go and say you don't like him.
That you won't marry him.

910
00:54:56,201 --> 00:54:58,036
Just say no really clearly. Please?

911
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:01,957
Forget it.

912
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,378
Put off your meeting or take a rain check.
Take care of it yourself.

913
00:55:08,464 --> 00:55:11,008
You remember this scar here?

914
00:55:11,091 --> 00:55:14,386
When I tried to teach that flirty girl
following Min-woo around a lesson,

915
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:16,263
I slipped and hit my head on a rock.

916
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:20,934
Of course, I remember.

917
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:22,895
You bled so much from your head

918
00:55:22,978 --> 00:55:26,023
that you were called the Bloody Head
of Hannam-dong for a while.

919
00:55:36,777 --> 00:55:40,239
Why is it here, of all places?
It's so close to Min-woo's restaurant.

920
00:55:45,286 --> 00:55:47,580
Where is this guy?

921
00:55:47,663 --> 00:55:48,914
CALLING
JIN YOUNG-SEO

922
00:55:57,965 --> 00:55:59,216
Do you have two phones?

923
00:56:02,803 --> 00:56:04,305
Oh, that's--

924
00:56:05,931 --> 00:56:11,395
KANG TAE-MOO'S NUMBER

925
00:56:13,314 --> 00:56:15,733
How dare you just get my number like that?

926
00:56:15,816 --> 00:56:19,528
We're going to get married,
so I should know all your phone numbers.

927
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:25,951
I'm not planning to marry you.

928
00:56:26,035 --> 00:56:28,120
How can I marry
someone I've only met once?

929
00:56:28,204 --> 00:56:30,539
Then why did you ask me
to get a room with you?

930
00:56:31,332 --> 00:56:33,209
Wasn't it because you liked me?

931
00:56:35,586 --> 00:56:36,587
That was--

932
00:56:36,671 --> 00:56:40,633
And you showing up to the date
means you're willing to get married, no?

933
00:56:40,716 --> 00:56:42,510
I was forced to go.

934
00:56:42,593 --> 00:56:45,680
I hate arranged marriages,
especially for business reasons.

935
00:56:46,347 --> 00:56:49,558
Anyway, please just forget
about all this marriage talk.

936
00:57:01,445 --> 00:57:04,699
Don't be like that.
Let's just get married.

937
00:57:06,158 --> 00:57:08,869
Look here, do you think marriage
is some kind of joke?

938
00:57:08,953 --> 00:57:11,747
How could you ask
just anyone to marry you?

939
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:15,126
Who says I'm going to marry just anyone?
The person I want to marry…

940
00:57:16,669 --> 00:57:17,503
is you.

941
00:57:20,715 --> 00:57:23,300
No way. I'm not going to marry
someone I barely know.

942
00:57:23,384 --> 00:57:25,511
-Then let's go on just ten dates.
-What?

943
00:57:25,594 --> 00:57:27,513
I'll give you a chance to get to know me.

944
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:30,016
Once you do,
you'll learn I have a lot of strengths.

945
00:57:31,434 --> 00:57:32,977
And I'm quite good…

946
00:57:35,521 --> 00:57:36,605
at many things.

947
00:57:37,356 --> 00:57:38,774
What do you mean, you're good--

948
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:58,252
What were you thinking about?

949
00:57:58,335 --> 00:58:00,087
I just meant that I'm good to women.

950
00:58:00,588 --> 00:58:04,091
I'm confident that you won't want
to see other men while seeing me.

951
00:58:06,052 --> 00:58:07,470
Forget it.

952
00:58:09,263 --> 00:58:12,933
I don't want to marry you or date you,

953
00:58:13,017 --> 00:58:15,686
so I hope to never see you again.

954
00:58:29,575 --> 00:58:32,078
Is he crazy or just dying to get married?

955
00:58:32,161 --> 00:58:35,164
Anyway, I think I've said enough
for him to not contact me again.

956
00:58:39,168 --> 00:58:41,837
-Are you done already?
-Let's just go.

957
00:58:53,516 --> 00:58:56,560
Damn it, this is what I was worried about!

958
00:58:57,728 --> 00:58:59,980
I can't run into him looking like this!

959
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,406
