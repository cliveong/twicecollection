00:00:00,064 --> 00:00:04,967
BUSINESS PROPOSAL

2
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:09,434
Do you want to go for a walk to sober up?

3
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:12,646
Sure.

4
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,362
What are you doing there?

5
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:29,621
Sir.

6
00:00:29,704 --> 00:00:33,500
Why are you two alone so late at night?

7
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:35,460
That's…

8
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:37,671
She and I had something to discuss work--

9
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:40,090
Stop. Enough!

10
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,383
Ms. Shin.

11
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,219
Why don't you explain yourself?

12
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:46,596
Why exactly

13
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:49,891
is the president of a company
meeting with his employee

14
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:52,727
secretly like this?

15
00:00:54,562 --> 00:00:56,022
That's…

16
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,151
It's suspicious.

17
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:02,779
Every time I see you,

18
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:09,077
you cover your face with your hair
like some female ghost.

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,787
Wait, sir.

20
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,247
-Sorry.
-Damn it.

21
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,873
Look at her, there she goes again.

22
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:15,583
Ms. Shin!

23
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:21,047
Chairman Kang.

24
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:22,007
Hello, sir!

25
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,135
What? Were you going
for a second round of drinks

26
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,678
with Chairman Kang without us?

27
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:27,679
Right?

28
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:29,848
What's she talking about?

29
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:32,642
Our team had a team dinner
with President Kang, sir.

30
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:35,478
All of you had a team dinner together?

31
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,939
Yes, sir. Since the researchers
have been working so hard lately,

32
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:41,359
President Kang bought us dinner
as a way to encourage us.

33
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:44,070
But our youngest employee
left her phone behind.

34
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:45,030
Is that so?

35
00:01:45,113 --> 00:01:47,782
Then you should have told me that
from the very beginning.

36
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:48,908
Right?

37
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:52,245
Why didn't you tell him? Ms. Shin.

38
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:54,414
What?

39
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,082
Right?

40
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:01,171
By the way, is that rumor true?
Is your hair really a wig…

41
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,551
She dropped the bomb!

42
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:08,803
We'll be going, then.

43
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:11,264
-Sure.
-Please get home safe.

44
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:12,348
Good night, sir!

45
00:02:14,684 --> 00:02:16,436
-Her cell phone!
-What?

46
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:17,812
Phone!

47
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,237
I should get going, too.

48
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:27,697
Yes, it's late, so you should.

49
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:28,615
Yes. Goodbye, sir.

50
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:30,033
Okay.

51
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:35,121
Look at her.

52
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:37,582
We should go, too.

53
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:38,750
Okay.

54
00:02:46,257 --> 00:02:47,300
Good night.

55
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:49,886
How long will you keep it a secret?

56
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:52,722
A secret?

57
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:56,476
I heard it from Director Go,
so don't even think about denying it.

58
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,312
You're seeing someone.

59
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:03,066
You even had the secretary's office
send her a pair of heels, right?

60
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:07,445
Is it the woman you brought to Sokcho?

61
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:12,617
Is that why you didn't go
on the blind date with Yu-jeong?

62
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:15,537
Who is it? Why are you hiding her
from me like this?

63
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,996
I'm not trying to hide her.

64
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,748
Are you worried I won't approve?

65
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,585
Don't you know me?

66
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:28,341
I approved of Geum-hui
because you said you liked her.

67
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:30,218
Have you already forgotten?

68
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:44,149
I'll introduce her to you soon.

69
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:47,068
So please trust me
and wait just a bit longer.

70
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:49,320
Good night.

71
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:52,699
Yes, Sung-hoon.

72
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:54,159
The TFT Report?

73
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:55,910
I'll check on it.

74
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:59,247
Who on earth is she?

75
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:04,465
EPISODE 10

76
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,881
I'm good. You guys can hang out
without me. I don't have any money.

77
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,926
What? Ye-jin's coming, too?

78
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,512
Okay, I'll call you later.

79
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:19,100
He was fine
at Won-sik's wedding last month.

80
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:23,188
You know how older people's condition
can change every day.

81
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:26,482
Besides, he was over 90 years old
and approaching 100.

82
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:29,110
Are you going to
Won-sik's grandfather's funeral?

83
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:30,987
Yes. We're going to Masan

84
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,406
and we'll be back tomorrow, so be good.

85
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:36,117
-What about the store?
-We'll have to close it for a day.

86
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:39,370
Lock the door well
and call us if anything happens.

87
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:42,081
I'll clean it up, so don't worry.

88
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:44,292
Mom, could you give me some money?

89
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,793
Ha-ri, we're going now.

90
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:48,171
Ha-ri's not home, Mom!

91
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,173
I have to use it for something.

92
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:53,968
Do you really need it?

93
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:55,386
Yes!

94
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:59,098
What are you going to spend it on?

95
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:01,434
Why are you spending so much money lately?

96
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:03,102
You always resort to violence.

97
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:05,897
It's better
than asking for money all the time.

98
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,524
Quiet! Where did she go
so early in the morning?

99
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:16,282
Why are you outside like this?

100
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:18,534
I couldn't stay in that house
all by myself.

101
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:21,412
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

102
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,790
I'm going to kill him!

103
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,043
Where is he? Where is that bastard?

104
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,504
Here.

105
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:34,175
I should warn you.
It's really big. I'm not kidding.

106
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:35,468
Like this.

107
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:39,389
It's still just a cockroach.

108
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,823
What's so scary about a cockroach?

109
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:58,908
You called me all the way here
on my day off.

110
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:03,204
If you were that scared,
why didn't you ask your boyfriend?

111
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:06,165
Ask what boyfriend?

112
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:10,461
What? What do you mean?

113
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,342
What? President Kang sent Mr. Cha
to the blind date in his place?

114
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:19,512
Kang Tae-moo is annoying,
but Cha Sung-hoon is even worse.

115
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:22,724
He's in the wrong, but he still
hasn't contacted me even once.

116
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:26,269
It's probably because he feels bad.
Don't be like that. Just--

117
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,355
No. It's all over. Dating or whatever.

118
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:33,985
If I keep seeing such an indecisive man,
I'll just become frustrated like I am now.

119
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,279
Come on.

120
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,240
Speaking of being frustrated,
don't you want some dumplings now?

121
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:40,491
What?

122
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:43,036
-Dumplings.
-Dumplings.

123
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,331
It's just around the corner.

124
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,082
I'm hungry.

125
00:06:51,252 --> 00:06:52,295
What?

126
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:55,631
-Cha Sung-hoon?
-Rock, paper, scissors!

127
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,261
-Why are those two…
-They're playing rock, paper, scissors?

128
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:01,346
Here you go.

129
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:06,851
Should I call them?

130
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:08,561
No, it's fine. They're going.

131
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:09,937
They're going.

132
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:11,689
-If they're leaving, why…
-Taxi!

133
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:15,735
-Come on, quick!
-Should I get in?

134
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:17,612
-Get in!
-Wait, hey.

135
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:20,406
Sir, could you follow
that blue car in front of us?

136
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,491
-Quickly!
-Sure.

137
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,950
You're going to follow them?

138
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:25,244
-Come on, get in!
-Get in?

139
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:35,713
We're about to break up,

140
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:38,633
but he's going on a joyride
with Kang Tae-moo?

141
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:40,635
They're both dead.

142
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:42,720
Why President Kang?

143
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:45,431
He must be here since
Mr. Cha's feeling depressed. Like me.

144
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:48,142
Have you forgotten who caused all this?

145
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:50,770
Who sent him
on that blind date in his place?

146
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,481
Right? Yes.

147
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:03,366
TRUE LIGHT ORPHANAGE

148
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:05,952
Thank you.

149
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:08,121
Where did they go?

150
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:09,872
I think they went in here, right?

151
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:10,915
Yes.

152
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:13,668
-Let's go.
-You're going in?

153
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:15,002
-Come on!
-Hey…

154
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:16,170
Have you been well?

155
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:17,588
Of course.

156
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:19,465
How long has it been?

157
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:21,509
-It's good to see you.
-What is this place?

158
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:24,011
-Are the kids doing well?
-Yes.

159
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:25,096
Young-seo?

160
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:35,106
How did you…

161
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,486
Mr. Cha, this is…

162
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,197
Are you…

163
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,159
This is my girlfriend.

164
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:49,537
Really? It's nice to meet you.

165
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,622
I'm glad you came.

166
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,918
Say hello. This is my mother.

167
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:00,798
-Hello.
-Hello.

168
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:02,175
Hello.

169
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:09,932
Then, you were
at that restaurant yesterday?

170
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:14,103
Sung-hoon wanted to introduce you to me.

171
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:25,323
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were coming yesterday…

172
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:26,824
Have some tea first.

173
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:28,826
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

174
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,661
Yes, thank you.

175
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,839
That's when Sung-hoon was five

176
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:44,175
on the day he first came here.

177
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:46,469
I see.

178
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:54,435
They're President Kang Tae-moo's parents.

179
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,105
When they were alive, they supported
our orphanage for a long time.

180
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:02,777
And thanks to that,

181
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,280
Sung-hoon came to live at my house
when he started middle school.

182
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:14,705
No wonder your relationship
seemed quite extraordinary.

183
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,166
Is that so?

184
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,755
-Hello.
-Hi.

185
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:25,341
Tae-woo, Ye-ri, and Min-gyu.
How have you been?

186
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,260
-Good.
-You've grown a lot.

187
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:28,553
Have you been eating well?

188
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:29,512
Yes!

189
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,139
What's this? A laptop?

190
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:33,057
Yes.

191
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,518
For the older children
going to high school.

192
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,435
That's cool.

193
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,020
-It must be nice.
-I'm so jealous.

194
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,147
I'll buy you one too
when you go to school.

195
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:44,694
Let's have a look.

196
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,987
Do you want to open it?

197
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,115
<i>I heard a lot about you from Sung-hoon.</i>

198
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:52,535
I didn't even know
that he had a story like this.

199
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,705
He usually doesn't tell people
what's going on inside his head.

200
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:00,376
So I was so surprised when he said he
wanted to introduce his girlfriend to me.

201
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,130
I'm sorry. I bet you were disappointed
when you saw me.

202
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:05,881
Disappointed?

203
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,384
It seems like it's all Sung-hoon's fault.

204
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,638
And now he's acting so indecisive
about how to apologize.

205
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:13,889
You're frustrated, right?

206
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,016
Yes.

207
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:16,934
How do you know so well?

208
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:19,562
It's like you're a psychic…

209
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,815
Sorry. I'm sorry.

210
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:25,401
That's just how he is.

211
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,654
He might act a bit frustrating sometimes,

212
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:33,534
but he's not a bad kid.
So try to understand him a bit.

213
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:37,997
I know that Mr. Cha is thoughtful
and dependable.

214
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:43,252
If Sung-hoon makes you
frustrated again, call me.

215
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:45,129
I'll buy you a drink.

216
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:46,172
Really?

217
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:50,509
I can really drink a lot.
Don't regret saying that later.

218
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,553
Okay, Mother?

219
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,939
Oh, right. If it's all right with you,
could you give me a picture of Mr. Cha?

220
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,691
He's just so cute.

221
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,862
He had a pretty smile even back then.

222
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:12,073
-He still does, doesn't he?
-Yes

223
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:14,950
He's so cute.

224
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:26,545
I'm sorry.

225
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,215
For not telling you about this.

226
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,889
Do you have an overdraft account?

227
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:39,266
What?

228
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:42,103
I recently made one for the first time.

229
00:12:42,937 --> 00:12:44,897
I didn't want to give in to my dad,

230
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,316
but my living expenses cost
a lot more than I expected.

231
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,110
So I made one,

232
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:51,529
and now I'm about 20 million won in debt.

233
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,157
Also, my blood type is Rh-negative B

234
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:58,077
so it's harder for me
to get transfusions than others.

235
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,246
My parents got a divorce
when I was in high school.

236
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,166
I know that my mom went to Germany

237
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,086
but I don't know
what she does or how she's doing.

238
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:11,382
Did I miss anything?

239
00:13:13,551 --> 00:13:15,594
-Young-seo.
-What I'm trying to say is

240
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,140
that I haven't told you
about many things too.

241
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:21,559
One day,

242
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:24,562
we'll be able to tell each other
about these things.

243
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:26,689
Once we get closer with time.

244
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:33,320
You shouldn't be sorry
about not telling me about it sooner,

245
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:34,238
but about

246
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:38,033
making me meet your mother
looking like this.

247
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,371
After our fight, you should have
begged me for forgiveness

248
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,457
and asked me
to come see your mother together.

249
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,001
If I dress up, I can look really pretty.

250
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:48,919
But today, look at me.

251
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,556
You still look pretty.

252
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,017
The prettiest in the world.

253
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,522
Then hug me
instead of just holding my hand.

254
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:14,695
Sung-hoon! Let's play together!

255
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:15,988
Okay, sure.

256
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:20,743
Hey, Sung-hoon's here.

257
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:24,246
I wonder if Ms. Jin's less angry now.

258
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,499
That was your…

259
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:28,876
It was your fault.

260
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:33,047
Why did you send Mr. Cha
to that blind date in your place?

261
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,758
What? Don't you know who I did that for?

262
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,635
Are you saying it was for me?

263
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:42,431
Who's the person who ran over
because she was worried

264
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,058
I might go on a blind date?

265
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:45,226
Worried?

266
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,728
There's no way I was worried.

267
00:14:47,812 --> 00:14:48,813
Who, me?

268
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:54,109
That's because you like me so much.

269
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:57,154
And it's because you said
you'd keep confessing your love to me

270
00:14:57,238 --> 00:14:58,280
until I accepted it.

271
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:01,575
"I should be kind and understanding,
and accept his feelings."

272
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:03,953
That's what I thought
when I ran there that day.

273
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,120
Is that so?

274
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,206
I had no idea.

275
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,459
Well, at least you know now.

276
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:23,013
Thank you for accepting my feelings.

277
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:26,475
What if someone sees us?

278
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,479
Who cares? I'm just hugging my girlfriend.

279
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:37,486
I can't wait until the entire world
knows about us.

280
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:49,331
It's because you feel bad
about lying to your grandfather, right?

281
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:53,836
Actually, that day, I--

282
00:15:54,628 --> 00:15:56,130
When you feel ready,

283
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:58,799
let's tell him.

284
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,768
Ha-ri! Come on, let's play together.

285
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:13,898
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

286
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:15,858
Over here. Pass it to me!

287
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,526
-Okay.
-Here!

288
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,569
Hey!

289
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:19,695
No!

290
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:21,822
-That's more like it!
-Over here!

291
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:23,532
Let's go!

292
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:36,211
-Okay.
-Shoot!

293
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,379
That's right!

294
00:17:00,027 --> 00:17:03,113
This is fun.
I haven't played with the kids in a while.

295
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:04,615
It feels great.

296
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:05,658
Yes.

297
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,826
I still feel a bit stiff.

298
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,536
Maybe it wasn't enough.

299
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,621
Right?

300
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:15,334
Really? You were both running so hard
and sprinting as fast as you could.

301
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:18,128
And after all that running,
the kids still look so fresh.

302
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:26,804
Yes, Hyeong-jun. What's up?

303
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,849
What? What about Ha-min?

304
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:39,108
Ha-min, what are you doing?

305
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,573
I'm looking at it right now.

306
00:17:46,657 --> 00:17:49,660
Ha-min's not answering my call.
He turned his phone off.

307
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:53,747
Okay, yes.

308
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,252
Ha-min, you son of a…

309
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,879
I'm going to kill him.

310
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,925
Sorry, you're here because of me.

311
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:06,343
It's fine.

312
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:08,470
You were cute even when you were young.

313
00:18:09,263 --> 00:18:11,140
Hey, what are you looking at?

314
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:14,727
Can you give me a picture
of when you were young?

315
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,563
Hey, his silliness is similar to mine.

316
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,774
I just can't get used to this.

317
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:23,110
Are you guys hungry?
Should we go eat something?

318
00:18:23,193 --> 00:18:24,611
Yes, I'm getting a bit hungry.

319
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,698
Are you taking customers?

320
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:29,825
One moment.

321
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:36,123
I just came back from hiking,
so my legs hurt and I'm hungry.

322
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:39,710
But all of the restaurants are on break,
so they're not taking customers.

323
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:42,713
Could I have some fried chicken?

324
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:45,174
But we…

325
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:48,177
Chicken.

326
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,185
She seems very hungry.
Let's make her some chicken.

327
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,312
Yes, let's do that.

328
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:04,359
Our smallest portion is half a chicken,
so let me get you half--

329
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:08,113
Half a chicken is way too small. Wait.

330
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:12,409
Come on in. They're open.

331
00:19:12,493 --> 00:19:13,744
Come on.

332
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:17,539
Look, a handsome guy
is working at this one.

333
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,665
Yes. He's handsome.

334
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,924
Can you give us ten fried chickens?
One of each kind.

335
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:29,885
-You're so handsome.
-Ten?

336
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,304
Some draft beer, first.
Some beer over here!

337
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:33,388
I want some soju.

338
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,765
Let me get you tables…

339
00:19:34,848 --> 00:19:36,225
Draft beers it is.

340
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,893
It'll be so delicious.

341
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,104
Eight glasses of draft beer.

342
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:42,773
-My gosh.
-You're so strong.

343
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,817
-Thank you.
-Thank you

344
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,903
-Here's some hot pizza too.
-Make way.

345
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,322
-It looks so good.
-Enjoy your meal.

346
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:52,449
This is a really good restaurant.

347
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:54,118
Let's go here. Want to say cheers?

348
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:55,661
Over here.

349
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:56,954
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

350
00:19:57,037 --> 00:19:58,247
It looks delicious!

351
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:02,000
Did you ever work as a waiter?
How are you so good?

352
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:03,377
For a bit in New York.

353
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,130
Did Tae-moo make you
earn money even in New York?

354
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:07,798
As if.

355
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:09,133
He worked with me.

356
00:20:09,216 --> 00:20:10,217
Really?

357
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:12,928
That's unexpected.

358
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:30,946
TUMBLING

359
00:20:37,494 --> 00:20:38,412
What's that?

360
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:40,497
This? It's powdered brown rice.

361
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:43,458
If you coat the chicken with it,
it becomes really crispy.

362
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,043
-Really?
-Yes.

363
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:46,795
I wonder what it tastes like.

364
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,505
Do you want to know?

365
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,675
COMPLETE

366
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,100
-Try it.
-What?

367
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:01,143
Say "ah."

368
00:21:06,857 --> 00:21:08,734
How is it? It's crispy, right?

369
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:13,614
But this is the customers'…

370
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:16,366
I fried more than usual
so we could eat too.

371
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:19,077
If you dip this in sauce,
it's even better.

372
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:33,717
This curry goes well with the chicken.

373
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,635
Right?

374
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:40,766
Is it still not done?
The customers are waiting.

375
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:42,434
Yes, it'll be right out.

376
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:44,144
Hurry.

377
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:47,564
Come on.

378
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,774
Come on, quick.

379
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:49,775
What are you doing?

380
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:51,151
You're drunk.

381
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:53,278
Be careful on your way back.

382
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:54,863
Where are you going, Yeong-suk?

383
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:57,824
Oh, my God.

384
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:00,744
Let me apologize

385
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,704
properly.

386
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:09,044
I'm sorry for making Sung-hoon
go to that blind date in my place.

387
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,504
It won't happen again.

388
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:13,423
I think your apology is kind of insincere.

389
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:17,719
-What?
-You should try a lot harder to apologize.

390
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,181
Or at least try to bribe me,
don't you think so?

391
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:23,642
A bribe?

392
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,153
Will this be enough?

393
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,038
What are you watching?

394
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:47,124
What? Nothing.

395
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:48,417
It's a bribe.

396
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,839
I'm sorry that you guys didn't
get to eat because of me.

397
00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:54,840
Help yourselves.

398
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:56,717
It's okay.

399
00:22:59,094 --> 00:22:59,928
Hey!

400
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:03,223
Oh, my goodness.

401
00:23:03,974 --> 00:23:05,934
Your expensive clothes will get stained.

402
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,394
-It's okay.
-Get him a tissue.

403
00:23:07,477 --> 00:23:09,021
Do you have any clothes for him?

404
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:11,106
Shin Ha-ri, my goodness.

405
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,650
One second.

406
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:28,206
You can change into this.

407
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,125
I can just let it dry.

408
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,793
I think it's going to stain.

409
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,046
I'll wash it quickly, so it'll be okay.

410
00:23:37,507 --> 00:23:38,759
Come on. Change.

411
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:41,595
You're going to watch me?

412
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:48,685
You can watch if you want.

413
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,689
Of course, I don't want to watch.
Go to Ha-min's room--

414
00:23:52,773 --> 00:23:53,648
No, I'll show you.

415
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,359
Come on, go to Ha-min's room and change.

416
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,323
We should have just spent the night there.

417
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:04,951
Why would you sleep over
at Man-sik's place?

418
00:24:05,535 --> 00:24:09,623
The whole neighborhood knows he used
to chase you around because he liked you.

419
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,667
What? Young-seo.

420
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,294
Why are you guys back so early?

421
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:18,548
Why are you here at this hour?

422
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,261
Who's this?

423
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:24,888
This is my boyfriend.

424
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:26,181
This is Ha-ri's father.

425
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:29,017
Really?

426
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,645
Oh, so you were having a drink together?

427
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:32,604
Yes.

428
00:24:33,897 --> 00:24:34,981
It's nice to meet you.

429
00:24:35,065 --> 00:24:38,026
I'm Ha-ri's father.

430
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,403
Nice to meet you. I'm Cha Sung-hoon.

431
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:43,657
Darn it. They can't find out.

432
00:24:52,165 --> 00:24:54,417
Is it okay to borrow
your brother's clothes?

433
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:57,170
It's fine. He won't even notice
that it's missing.

434
00:24:58,797 --> 00:24:59,965
What's so funny?

435
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:02,008
-It's just…
-Ms. Han!

436
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:05,971
Ms. Han!

437
00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:07,973
Why do you keep calling me today?

438
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:10,517
Ms. Han!

439
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:13,687
Ha-ri, your parents are back!

440
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,688
Yes, I'm back.

441
00:25:14,771 --> 00:25:15,981
Wait, I…

442
00:25:18,692 --> 00:25:20,735
-Shoes.
-Shoes?

443
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:27,117
Ms. Han, wait.

444
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,410
What?

445
00:25:29,202 --> 00:25:30,412
Well…

446
00:25:31,788 --> 00:25:33,790
Please let me introduce you
to my boyfriend.

447
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:34,833
-Boyfriend?
-Yes.

448
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,376
You've got a boyfriend?

449
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:38,170
Where is he? Where?

450
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,513
He's at the store. Yes. He's at the store.

451
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:49,514
He is?

452
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:51,808
-Let's go down to the store.
-Really?

453
00:25:51,892 --> 00:25:52,934
-Let's go.
-Sure.

454
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,728
I wonder where Ha-min is. I'll--

455
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:32,140
Have another glass.

456
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:35,185
We must have interrupted your date.

457
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:36,353
Not at all.

458
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:39,856
Let me pour you a glass, sir.

459
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,316
Sure.

460
00:26:42,275 --> 00:26:44,361
-He's handsome, Young-seo.
-Right?

461
00:26:45,987 --> 00:26:47,864
Sung-hoon? Mr. Cha Sung-hoon?

462
00:26:47,948 --> 00:26:49,199
Yes, ma'am. Cha Sung-hoon.

463
00:26:49,282 --> 00:26:50,909
Just looking at his face
must make you happy!

464
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:53,536
Right? Isn't he so handsome?

465
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:56,706
How did you two meet? Where?

466
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,458
Did Ha-ri set you guys up?

467
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:00,585
No, they live next to each other.

468
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:01,503
Yes.

469
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:04,631
Mom, Dad. You must be tired.
Should we call it a night now?

470
00:27:04,714 --> 00:27:07,676
I'm not tired. Honey, are you tired?

471
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,177
-What?
-He's not.

472
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:10,512
-Right.
-He's not.

473
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,222
If you are, go ahead and rest.

474
00:27:12,305 --> 00:27:14,474
-Dad must be tired.
-No, he's not tired.

475
00:27:15,976 --> 00:27:18,353
So you're working as a secretary?

476
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,938
Isn't it so hard?

477
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:25,193
I heard that the president of your company
is well known for being fussy and mean.

478
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:26,528
Oh, my goodness.

479
00:27:28,238 --> 00:27:29,739
He's not that kind of person.

480
00:27:29,823 --> 00:27:31,616
He's very kind and gentle.

481
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,871
-Pour me a glass, too.
-Sure.

482
00:27:38,248 --> 00:27:40,500
After this, I'll speak more casually.

483
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:42,252
Please do so.

484
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:49,634
This is nice. Getting a drink
from my second daughter's boyfriend.

485
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:56,933
Do you remember when Young-seo
first came to our house?

486
00:27:57,017 --> 00:28:01,438
She was so skinny
as if she hadn't eaten for days.

487
00:28:03,106 --> 00:28:05,317
She moved schools
when she was in high school.

488
00:28:06,735 --> 00:28:09,362
But apparently,
she just slept at lunchtime

489
00:28:09,446 --> 00:28:11,615
without eating a single grain of rice.

490
00:28:11,698 --> 00:28:15,702
So Ha-ri brought her home
after school. To feed her.

491
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,622
The meal you cooked for me
was so delicious.

492
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:20,957
After that, I kept coming back
to eat your food.

493
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:24,169
You can keep coming,
and I'll cook for you.

494
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:27,255
You can do it even
after you get married and have a baby.

495
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:30,008
Here.

496
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:32,218
-What?
-Who drank it all? It's empty.

497
00:28:32,302 --> 00:28:35,722
Oh, my. Since there's no more alcohol,
let's wrap this up, shall we?

498
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:38,433
Yes. I'll officially
introduce Sung-hoon next time.

499
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,935
-Yes.
-No, I'm just getting started.

500
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:45,106
Remember the traditional liquor you got
when you received that company award?

501
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,441
What happened to that?

502
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,734
Where did I put that?

503
00:28:47,817 --> 00:28:51,655
What do you mean? I put it
in Ha-ri's room with her certificate.

504
00:28:51,738 --> 00:28:53,156
We should drink that.

505
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,200
My room? Dad, wait.

506
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:57,202
-Wait!
-Dad, I'll go get it!

507
00:28:57,285 --> 00:28:58,495
There's a bit left here.

508
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:00,914
It doesn't matter who brings it.

509
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:02,374
My dad's coming in!

510
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:06,086
Let's see.

511
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:10,131
Gosh.

512
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,387
It's good that we saved it, right?

513
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,971
Yes.

514
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,306
Goodness.

515
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:21,643
Honey.

516
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:26,398
President Kang.

517
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:28,149
President Kang!

518
00:29:30,944 --> 00:29:31,986
Ha-ri!

519
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,948
Oh, on.

520
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:37,450
Are you all right?
You must have been startled.

521
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,372
I don't think it'll end soon.

522
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:56,886
-Maybe…
-Yes?

523
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,931
You can jump down from here.

524
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:05,311
I'll die.

525
00:30:05,395 --> 00:30:06,396
-Right?
-Yes.

526
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:07,856
I just feel so anxious.

527
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,442
Ha-ri, what are you doing in there?

528
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:11,526
I'm coming!

529
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,489
-I should…
-Go back in there. I'll come back soon.

530
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,535
Don't rummage around in there.

531
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:21,786
What? Okay.

532
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:30,879
Right now!

533
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,088
Now?

534
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:38,928
Why is this so high?

535
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:41,306
Mr. Cha, can you get this for me?

536
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:42,807
Sure.

537
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,059
-Yes.
-Here.

538
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,353
-Which one? That one?
-Yes.

539
00:30:47,437 --> 00:30:48,563
-Wait.
-That one?

540
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:49,647
How about this one?

541
00:30:50,356 --> 00:30:52,025
Which one should I get?

542
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:53,359
Which one?

543
00:30:53,443 --> 00:30:54,527
-This one.
-This one?

544
00:30:57,906 --> 00:30:59,908
This one? That one looks good, too.

545
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,618
-Get this one for me.
-This one?

546
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:05,288
Ha-ri, where are you going?

547
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:08,541
Ha-ri's going down to the store
to get some beer.

548
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:11,503
Mr. Shin, let's have
another drink together.

549
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:14,631
Let's do that.

550
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:16,508
That scared me.

551
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:20,136
You have no idea how scared I was.
What a relief.

552
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,141
What are you thinking about?

553
00:31:25,225 --> 00:31:26,434
What?

554
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:31,189
I was wondering how much longer
we need to keep this a secret.

555
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:34,776
They seemed to like Sung-hoon.

556
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:37,695
I want to introduce myself
to them officially too.

557
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,239
Ye-jin, did you get back home?

558
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:41,449
Yes, I'm almost home.

559
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,784
What?

560
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,078
Okay, call me later.
Let's watch another movie.

561
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:46,621
-Yes, let's do that.
-Get down!

562
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:51,709
My gosh.

563
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:53,670
This car is awesome.

564
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,257
When will I get to drive a car like this?

565
00:32:01,427 --> 00:32:03,972
When can I buy something like this?

566
00:32:08,935 --> 00:32:10,228
Shin Ha-ri!

567
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:18,736
Hey!

568
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:20,363
Wait a second.

569
00:32:20,446 --> 00:32:22,282
-Who's this?
-I'm--

570
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:24,367
Ha-min, I can explain. Just a moment.

571
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,369
Hey, isn't that my shirt?

572
00:32:26,953 --> 00:32:28,913
Are you dating some jobless bum?

573
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:30,039
Is he broke?

574
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:32,208
-My money…
-No, that's not it…

575
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:35,086
Hey, what kind of punk are you?
Why are you with my sister?

576
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:37,297
Hey, watch your mouth!
This is the president.

577
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,256
President?

578
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,966
What president?

579
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:41,134
I'm sorry.

580
00:32:41,217 --> 00:32:43,428
I'll tell you who I am.

581
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:50,685
I'm Kang Tae-moo, the president
of go food and Ha-ri's boyfriend.

582
00:32:52,228 --> 00:32:55,523
Kang Tae-moo, the president of go food?

583
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:02,155
I'm sorry. I was so rude.

584
00:33:02,238 --> 00:33:03,948
No, I should be apologizing.

585
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:06,618
But out of all people, why date my sister?

586
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,537
Does she have something on you?

587
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,414
Is she blackmailing you?

588
00:33:11,497 --> 00:33:12,373
Ha-min.

589
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:19,172
I don't mind being blackmailed
if I can stay with her forever.

590
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:22,800
What was that?

591
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:26,554
You're a really straightforward guy,
brother-in-law?

592
00:33:29,182 --> 00:33:30,016
Brother-in-law?

593
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:30,934
Yes.

594
00:33:36,397 --> 00:33:38,483
Go buy yourself some clothes,
brother-in-law.

595
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:41,486
This is awesome!
Thanks, fellow brother-in-law.

596
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:43,321
Stop it. You're going to spoil him.

597
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:44,405
Ha-min.

598
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,744
Come by the office sometime.
I'll pay you back for today.

599
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:52,121
Do you mean it? I'll really go soon.

600
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:53,081
Sure.

601
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,082
Goodbye, now.

602
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,583
-Good night.
-Get home safe.

603
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,627
Goodbye. I'll see you later.

604
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:00,380
Call me!

605
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:03,633
Bye.

606
00:34:03,716 --> 00:34:04,926
He's so cool.

607
00:34:05,551 --> 00:34:06,886
Follow me, Ha-min.

608
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,096
Damn it.

609
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,514
You little…

610
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:10,598
-What?
-Hey!

611
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,392
How on earth did you two meet?

612
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:14,602
Never mind that.

613
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:17,105
-I'll tell Mom and Dad--
-You won't tell them, right?

614
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,357
Then I won't tell them about him either.

615
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:23,778
Okay.

616
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,113
Keep your promise.

617
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,322
Of course.

618
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,159
Anyway, does his family know
that you're dating?

619
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,496
Why do you want to know?

620
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:36,374
I'm just worried
that a rich family like his

621
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:38,626
won't be happy
with a normal family like ours.

622
00:34:39,335 --> 00:34:42,714
We won't be able to cover your marriage
expenses even if we sell our store.

623
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:45,299
Should I debut as an idol
and make that money?

624
00:34:52,932 --> 00:34:54,684
Do you think becoming an idol is easy?

625
00:34:56,185 --> 00:34:58,146
Stop talking nonsense and don't worry.

626
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,189
Let's go home.

627
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,400
Wait for me.

628
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:32,722
So adorable.

629
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,477
<i>Young-seo…</i>

630
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,104
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

631
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,319
-<i>Tae-moo, do something.</i>
-What's this?

632
00:35:46,402 --> 00:35:47,528
When did you get here?

633
00:35:48,154 --> 00:35:51,574
This? Mr. Kang gave it to me as a bribe.

634
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,286
-Erase it!
-Why? It's so cute.

635
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:56,370
Come on, erase it.

636
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,164
"Young-seo, I can't break up with you!"

637
00:35:58,247 --> 00:35:59,916
Young-seo, erase it, come on.

638
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:01,709
"Young-seo, why aren't you responding?"

639
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,503
-No, erase it.
-No, don't erase it.

640
00:36:03,586 --> 00:36:04,879
Don't move, wait…

641
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,923
Wait, that hurts, wait…

642
00:36:11,427 --> 00:36:13,262
Cha Sung-hoon, 29 years old.

643
00:36:13,346 --> 00:36:15,723
He's currently working as a secretary
at go food.

644
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:20,478
Okay. You can go.

645
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:21,479
Sir.

646
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:26,984
I told her to try
getting with Kang Tae-moo,

647
00:36:27,777 --> 00:36:29,445
but she's seeing his secretary?

648
00:36:34,117 --> 00:36:35,451
<i>BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI</i>

649
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:38,371
I registered my marriage
with Geum-hui today.

650
00:36:38,454 --> 00:36:39,497
What?

651
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:43,960
-What did you say?
-So please approve of our relationship.

652
00:36:45,253 --> 00:36:46,379
What about Ye-ri then?

653
00:36:46,462 --> 00:36:47,338
I'm sorry.

654
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,340
The only woman I love

655
00:36:50,424 --> 00:36:51,759
is Geum-hui.

656
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,887
Don't you know
what Ye-ri has done for you?

657
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:57,306
You ungrateful bastard!

658
00:36:58,891 --> 00:37:00,101
You bastard!

659
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,437
The merger and acquisition is coming up.

660
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,523
How dare you do this?

661
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:09,360
Sir, I'm going to back out
of this merger and acquisition.

662
00:37:14,615 --> 00:37:15,533
Ms. Oh!

663
00:37:16,826 --> 00:37:17,994
Ms. Oh!

664
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,746
-Father!
-Sir!

665
00:37:21,414 --> 00:37:24,792
Father! Mr. Kim, call the ambulance.

666
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,502
-My goodness.
<i>-Father!</i>

667
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,588
No way.

668
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:30,923
Did he really die?

669
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:32,758
Gwang-bok's father?

670
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:34,969
That makes no sense.

671
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:38,014
How can he die of shock because
his son's marrying a regular woman?

672
00:37:38,097 --> 00:37:40,516
Parents are just like that.

673
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,645
If you're rich, it's only natural to want
a daughter-in-law from a rich family.

674
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,647
I guess it's better for people

675
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,025
from two similar families
to marry each other.

676
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,320
I hope his family isn't like that.

677
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:54,780
What?

678
00:37:54,864 --> 00:37:56,240
Nothing.

679
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,243
-Hello.
-Min-woo!

680
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:00,912
Hi, Min-woo.

681
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,040
Min-woo, what brings you here
at this hour?

682
00:38:04,123 --> 00:38:07,376
I brought some good abalones for you.
You like abalones, Mr. Shin.

683
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,214
But they're so expensive.

684
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:13,341
Min-woo, you haven't
eaten dinner yet, right?

685
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,968
We were about to eat some noodles.

686
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:17,553
No, I've already eaten.

687
00:38:18,054 --> 00:38:19,430
By the way, where's Ha-ri?

688
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:21,307
She went out to see Yoo-ra.

689
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,767
-Yoo-ra?
-Yes.

690
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:26,437
She wanted to have a drink with Ha-ri.
I thought you'd be with them.

691
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:36,364
You wanted to see me? What's the occasion?

692
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:39,533
Would you like a drink, too?

693
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,535
Please get us another glass.

694
00:38:45,331 --> 00:38:46,832
You said you needed to talk.

695
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,293
Didn't you say it's urgent?

696
00:38:53,005 --> 00:38:54,131
Shin Ha-ri.

697
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:56,717
You…

698
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:01,055
Can you please get out of Min-woo's life?

699
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,517
Are you trying
to get back at me or something?

700
00:39:06,102 --> 00:39:07,061
What?

701
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,231
You told me seven years ago
that you liked Min-woo.

702
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:13,693
And you said that you'd back off
if I felt the same way.

703
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,154
Yes. I wasn't interested in him at first.

704
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,032
But since you said you liked him,

705
00:39:20,116 --> 00:39:22,952
I decided to date him
because I didn't want to give him to you.

706
00:39:23,035 --> 00:39:26,289
But you're trying to sway Min-woo
because of that now? How petty.

707
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:28,457
I think you're really drunk.

708
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:32,044
-Let's talk next time.
-Why didn't you tell him about that?

709
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:35,089
That I dated Seong-gyu
behind Min-woo's back

710
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,716
before I went to study abroad.

711
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:40,011
If you had told Min-woo about that,

712
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:41,804
he and I would've broken up.

713
00:39:41,887 --> 00:39:44,390
Then you two might be dating right now.

714
00:39:45,308 --> 00:39:46,559
Why didn't you tell him?

715
00:39:50,563 --> 00:39:52,356
I thought it was too cruel.

716
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:57,945
How could I tell that to a guy whose
entire world ended when you left him?

717
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:01,282
But Yoo-ra,

718
00:40:02,325 --> 00:40:04,201
right now, I regret it.

719
00:40:06,412 --> 00:40:08,456
I wish I had told Min-woo about it.

720
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:16,297
Min-woo.

721
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:28,851
Ha-ri.

722
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:29,894
Ha-ri!

723
00:40:32,146 --> 00:40:33,397
What did you mean by that?

724
00:40:33,939 --> 00:40:34,982
What you said just now.

725
00:40:36,817 --> 00:40:39,612
You're making a huge mistake.
You shouldn't be doing this.

726
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:41,572
To both me and Yoo-ra.

727
00:40:44,658 --> 00:40:45,618
Okay.

728
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,453
I'm sorry, Ha-ri.

729
00:40:47,536 --> 00:40:49,705
Don't apologize to me.
Go apologize to Yoo-ra.

730
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,541
Now that I've seen how you act,

731
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,544
I can understand
why Yoo-ra's acting that way.

732
00:41:15,856 --> 00:41:18,192
Hello? What's up?
You don't usually call this late.

733
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,360
It's just…

734
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:22,154
I stepped out for a bit

735
00:41:23,406 --> 00:41:25,574
and got bored.

736
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:29,120
I miss you too.

737
00:41:31,747 --> 00:41:33,874
You have a weird way
of telling me you miss me.

738
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:36,127
Do you want me to come?

739
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,712
No, it's okay.

740
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,464
It's late.

741
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,135
Let's…

742
00:41:45,177 --> 00:41:48,347
go on a proper date after work tomorrow.

743
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:53,352
<i>Let's go somewhere nice. Okay?</i>

744
00:42:07,268 --> 00:42:10,104
Hello. You two came to work early.

745
00:42:10,187 --> 00:42:11,313
Hey.

746
00:42:15,442 --> 00:42:19,321
I made a few different versions
of the mint chocolate cookie.

747
00:42:19,405 --> 00:42:22,241
Could you check the ingredients
and pick the best one?

748
00:42:22,324 --> 00:42:23,242
Sure.

749
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:25,452
Mr. Gye.

750
00:42:25,536 --> 00:42:29,331
Didn't you say you'd change the formula
for the mint chocolate ice cream bar?

751
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,919
Mr. Gye?

752
00:42:34,003 --> 00:42:36,046
Ms. Kim, tell Ms. Yeo

753
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:39,133
that I'll turn in the formula sheet
later this afternoon.

754
00:42:40,092 --> 00:42:42,219
-What?
-Why would you ask Ms. Kim to…

755
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,721
Mr. Gye.

756
00:42:43,804 --> 00:42:46,682
Please get it to me before noon.

757
00:42:49,143 --> 00:42:50,352
Mr. Gye!

758
00:42:50,436 --> 00:42:52,646
Ms. Kim, please tell Ms. Yeo

759
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,190
that I'm going to come up
with the formulas right now.

760
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:57,151
Coffee.

761
00:42:58,027 --> 00:43:00,446
-I can't believe him.
-Did you two have a fight?

762
00:43:04,283 --> 00:43:06,118
Last weekend, all of us who entered
the company together met up.

763
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:09,413
And he wanted to tell the people there
that we're in a relationship.

764
00:43:09,496 --> 00:43:12,291
I said no, and now he's mad at me.

765
00:43:12,374 --> 00:43:14,460
I think that was your fault, Ms. Yeo.

766
00:43:14,543 --> 00:43:16,754
I know it might seem a bit weird

767
00:43:16,837 --> 00:43:18,422
because you two are quite old,

768
00:43:18,505 --> 00:43:19,673
but why does it matter?

769
00:43:19,757 --> 00:43:20,883
You have no idea.

770
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:24,053
Nothing good comes out of people
knowing you're dating someone at work.

771
00:43:24,136 --> 00:43:26,847
If either one of us
makes a mistake while working,

772
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,975
people will talk behind our backs
that we slacked off.

773
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:31,477
If we break up,

774
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,355
then they'll talk about
whose fault it was behind our backs.

775
00:43:34,438 --> 00:43:35,856
I don't want to think about it.

776
00:43:36,398 --> 00:43:38,984
I don't know why people are so nosy.

777
00:43:39,068 --> 00:43:42,321
Did you hear about that newbie
who's dating Mr. Cho?

778
00:43:42,404 --> 00:43:43,280
Who?

779
00:43:43,364 --> 00:43:44,698
The one from the admin team.

780
00:43:44,782 --> 00:43:47,284
Mr. Cho? The handsome guy
who looks like Jung-kook?

781
00:43:47,368 --> 00:43:48,494
Who's dating him?

782
00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:50,579
I'm going to ask in the group chat.

783
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:52,206
Here's one.

784
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:54,625
Someone who's really nosy.

785
00:43:57,127 --> 00:43:58,253
Right.

786
00:43:58,337 --> 00:44:00,214
The microbial analysis table is ready.

787
00:44:00,297 --> 00:44:01,548
I'm going down.

788
00:44:01,632 --> 00:44:02,508
Okay.

789
00:44:03,634 --> 00:44:05,844
It's no problem.

790
00:44:05,928 --> 00:44:09,598
It's their job, ma'am.

791
00:44:11,392 --> 00:44:13,811
Tae-moo visited a couple of days ago?

792
00:44:14,978 --> 00:44:15,854
What?

793
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:18,273
He went there with who?

794
00:44:24,363 --> 00:44:27,449
I got here as quickly as I could.
Did you wait for a long time?

795
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:29,827
No. What do you want to eat?

796
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:32,496
Korean, Japanese, Chinese, or Western.
Just say the word.

797
00:44:32,996 --> 00:44:35,666
I can get a table at any
restaurant in Seoul with one call.

798
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,838
Then let's start
with some greasy Western food,

799
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:42,840
and finish off
with some spicy Korean food?

800
00:44:43,507 --> 00:44:44,424
Sure.

801
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:16,498
I've always wanted to go
on a certain kind of date

802
00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:18,667
in weather like this if I got a boyfriend.

803
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,793
I want to do that now.

804
00:45:22,004 --> 00:45:22,921
Can we?

805
00:45:25,174 --> 00:45:27,301
The subway is the best when it rains.

806
00:45:27,384 --> 00:45:28,927
There's no traffic or anything.

807
00:45:42,316 --> 00:45:45,777
<i>The next station is Dangsan station.</i>

808
00:45:46,612 --> 00:45:49,573
<i>The doors are on your right.</i>

809
00:45:49,656 --> 00:45:52,618
<i>If you are heading towards Gaehwa
or Sinnonhyeon,</i>

810
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:54,953
<i>please transfer to line…</i>

811
00:45:55,037 --> 00:45:55,871
Ha-ri.

812
00:46:09,092 --> 00:46:10,260
Thanks.

813
00:46:12,846 --> 00:46:14,806
Have you ever been on a subway in Korea?

814
00:46:15,891 --> 00:46:17,184
No, it's my first time.

815
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:19,186
It's your first time? With me, right now?

816
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,480
What?

817
00:46:21,563 --> 00:46:22,648
Really?

818
00:46:23,273 --> 00:46:24,816
Korean subways are the best.

819
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:28,987
This train is the one I used to take
when I was in college.

820
00:46:29,655 --> 00:46:32,157
My house was in the east,
and my school was in the west.

821
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:34,576
One day, Young-seo and I were
on the train together,

822
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,119
and we both fell asleep.

823
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,996
We should have woken up,

824
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,500
but we fell asleep
until we got to the last station.

825
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:46,255
Is the restaurant
that you want to go to nearby?

826
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:49,591
Before that, we need to go somewhere.

827
00:46:49,675 --> 00:46:50,759
Follow me.

828
00:47:06,984 --> 00:47:09,278
It's so pretty.

829
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:10,821
Do you like flowers?

830
00:47:10,904 --> 00:47:12,781
Is there a woman who doesn't?

831
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:15,617
It was my dream to go to a place
like this with my boyfriend

832
00:47:15,701 --> 00:47:16,827
if I ever got one.

833
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,120
It came true then.

834
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:20,163
That's true.

835
00:47:21,957 --> 00:47:24,626
The carnations are so pretty.
So many different colors.

836
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,295
Look, there are purple carnations.

837
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:29,464
I think those are lisianthuses,
not carnations.

838
00:47:31,091 --> 00:47:34,469
Right, lisian… Yes.

839
00:47:35,387 --> 00:47:36,805
This one's pretty too.

840
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:38,849
These are…

841
00:47:39,641 --> 00:47:41,059
Probably not carnations.

842
00:47:41,935 --> 00:47:43,145
Aren't those <i>mudans</i>?

843
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:44,313
<i>Mudans</i>?

844
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,108
Nope, these are Peonies.

845
00:47:50,402 --> 00:47:51,820
They're the same thing.

846
00:47:54,823 --> 00:47:58,827
Hey, the name doesn't matter.
Don't be bound by formalities.

847
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,203
I was trying to say,

848
00:48:00,287 --> 00:48:02,622
"focus on the beauty
of the flower", you know?

849
00:48:02,706 --> 00:48:05,083
That's true.
Whether you're Geum-hui or Ha-ri,

850
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:08,045
you're still the prettiest woman
in the world.

851
00:48:10,881 --> 00:48:12,966
Is today some special anniversary
or something?

852
00:48:13,884 --> 00:48:15,344
How would you like your flowers?

853
00:48:15,427 --> 00:48:16,261
Well…

854
00:48:18,347 --> 00:48:19,765
Here you go.

855
00:48:22,392 --> 00:48:23,935
Is this right?

856
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,940
Look at those flowers. I'm so jealous.

857
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:32,152
I almost forgot.

858
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:36,198
There's food that we have to eat
on a rainy day like this.

859
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:37,783
Let's go.

860
00:48:38,992 --> 00:48:40,077
Thank you.

861
00:48:40,786 --> 00:48:42,037
Enjoy.

862
00:48:51,463 --> 00:48:53,173
It's so good.

863
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:55,425
Is it really that good?

864
00:48:56,009 --> 00:48:59,137
When the weather is so humid
and gloomy like this,

865
00:48:59,971 --> 00:49:03,809
you need to eat some <i>jeon</i>
that are oily and crispy like this.

866
00:49:03,892 --> 00:49:04,726
Try it.

867
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:16,780
The texture is very unique.

868
00:49:18,073 --> 00:49:20,158
How did they make it so crispy?

869
00:49:20,242 --> 00:49:22,119
No, don't do that.

870
00:49:22,202 --> 00:49:24,996
We're on a date. Don't talk about work.

871
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,331
Stop thinking about work.

872
00:49:26,957 --> 00:49:28,667
Look.

873
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,294
You need to enjoy the food like this.

874
00:49:39,594 --> 00:49:40,554
Like this?

875
00:49:40,637 --> 00:49:42,305
Yes, like that.

876
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:48,311
<i>He came with an employee.</i>

877
00:49:48,395 --> 00:49:51,440
<i>I think her name was Shin Ha-ri.</i>

878
00:49:51,523 --> 00:49:53,358
If you look at it this way,

879
00:49:54,651 --> 00:49:56,319
she looks a bit similar.

880
00:49:58,363 --> 00:50:01,533
But at the same time, she doesn't.

881
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:09,207
Secretary Kim.

882
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:13,420
There's an employee named Shin Ha-ri

883
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:16,590
in Food Product Development Team 1…

884
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:17,883
This one looks good, too.

885
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:24,806
Excuse me.

886
00:50:36,276 --> 00:50:38,111
Why is it pouring again?

887
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,245
I'm going down right now.

888
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:49,289
Yes.

889
00:50:49,372 --> 00:50:52,083
You know, President Kang?

890
00:50:53,502 --> 00:50:56,087
Doesn't he look more and more
like the late president?

891
00:50:56,171 --> 00:50:57,672
Tell me about it.

892
00:50:57,756 --> 00:51:01,384
Sometimes, I'm surprised
how much they look alike.

893
00:51:01,468 --> 00:51:02,552
Right?

894
00:51:04,346 --> 00:51:05,597
So what if he's the heir?

895
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,600
When he witnessed
his parents' car accident as a child.

896
00:51:08,683 --> 00:51:10,602
It was an accident in the rain, right?

897
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:14,272
Yes. That's why
he can't even drive when it rains.

898
00:51:19,653 --> 00:51:21,321
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

899
00:52:06,074 --> 00:52:07,158
What is it?

900
00:52:07,242 --> 00:52:08,868
I wanted to sit next to you.

901
00:52:19,462 --> 00:52:20,839
Thanks.

902
00:52:25,051 --> 00:52:29,264
Ms. Yeo and Mr. Gye
had a really bad fight today.

903
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:32,017
It got really uncomfortable.

904
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,438
President Kang, you can't make it obvious
to the employees when you're upset, okay?

905
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:38,773
Your employees will feel so uncomfortable.

906
00:52:39,524 --> 00:52:41,234
Anyway…

907
00:52:41,318 --> 00:52:43,153
it wasn't like
I could take someone's side.

908
00:52:43,236 --> 00:52:46,072
I thought about what to do
for a long time with Ms. Kim.

909
00:52:46,156 --> 00:52:49,826
Then we decided to have them talk it out
rather than take anyone's side.

910
00:52:49,909 --> 00:52:51,828
So we wanted to let them talk…

911
00:52:52,412 --> 00:52:55,498
Yes, it's still raining a lot, Mom.

912
00:53:07,052 --> 00:53:09,262
Is the restaurant
you wanted to go to nearby?

913
00:53:09,846 --> 00:53:13,099
We need to go somewhere before that.
Follow me.

914
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:25,153
It's done.

915
00:53:28,156 --> 00:53:29,699
Is this right?

916
00:53:32,744 --> 00:53:34,913
Look at those flowers. I'm so jealous.

917
00:53:34,996 --> 00:53:37,499
-The rain's stopped. Let's go.
-Yes, let's go.

918
00:53:44,381 --> 00:53:46,966
I almost forgot.

919
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,803
There's food that we have to eat
on a rainy day like this.

920
00:53:51,388 --> 00:53:53,556
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

921
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:58,061
You have no idea how hard I tried.
I really hate situations like that.

922
00:53:58,144 --> 00:54:03,983
So, actually, I was thinking
about suggesting we go for a drink today.

923
00:54:04,067 --> 00:54:05,527
But we brought the car.

924
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,196
So I told myself
that we'd go get a drink next time

925
00:54:08,279 --> 00:54:09,906
when we didn't have the car with us.

926
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:11,950
I actually drink a lot with Young-seo--

927
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:18,206
What?

928
00:54:21,584 --> 00:54:24,129
Walking like this feels nice.

929
00:54:24,212 --> 00:54:25,922
Let's leave the car
behind again next time.

930
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,218
How long have you known?

931
00:54:38,435 --> 00:54:40,603
I guess I'm the one
who didn't have the courage.

932
00:54:42,522 --> 00:54:44,315
I've been wanting to tell you

933
00:54:45,024 --> 00:54:46,943
all about it one day…

934
00:54:48,945 --> 00:54:50,447
but I couldn't.

935
00:54:53,408 --> 00:54:55,034
I'm sorry.

936
00:54:55,744 --> 00:54:57,495
I tried to pretend I didn't know, but…

937
00:54:59,122 --> 00:55:01,750
If I hurt your feelings, I'm sorry.

938
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:02,959
It's not that.

939
00:55:04,919 --> 00:55:07,130
I was thinking about
how to not seem too pathetic

940
00:55:07,213 --> 00:55:11,134
when explaining my weakness
to a woman I like.

941
00:55:13,928 --> 00:55:14,846
Ha-ri.

942
00:55:16,723 --> 00:55:17,557
I…

943
00:55:47,587 --> 00:55:48,838
You're almost here?

944
00:55:49,547 --> 00:55:50,548
All right.

945
00:55:53,676 --> 00:55:55,845
Wait just a little. I called for the car.

946
00:55:55,929 --> 00:55:57,597
I'll just go back by myself today.

947
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,308
Young-seo wants to see me,
so I need to go.

948
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:01,559
Really?

949
00:56:02,227 --> 00:56:03,978
Then let me give you a ride.

950
00:56:04,062 --> 00:56:06,648
It's okay. We're meeting near here.

951
00:56:06,731 --> 00:56:08,149
I'll call you later.

952
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,860
Get home safely.

953
00:57:08,835 --> 00:57:10,170
Hello, Chairman Kang.

954
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:14,340
Please sit, Ms. Shin Geum-hui…

955
00:57:14,424 --> 00:57:15,383
No.

956
00:57:16,134 --> 00:57:17,510
Shin Ha-ri.

957
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:41,201
What exactly is your deal?

958
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,706
Why did you approach Tae-moo?

959
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,376
What?

960
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:53,087
Where?

961
00:57:55,048 --> 00:57:57,175
Okay, I'll call you later.

962
00:58:14,776 --> 00:58:16,486
Why isn't she picking up?

963
00:58:28,957 --> 00:58:31,918
Stop seeing Tae-moo.

964
00:58:32,794 --> 00:58:35,463
I don't think
you want to be in a situation

965
00:58:35,546 --> 00:58:37,632
that other people may misinterpret.

966
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:40,927
Sir, I have something to tell you…

967
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,679
Yes, Sung-hoon.

968
00:58:43,805 --> 00:58:44,681
What?

969
00:58:45,974 --> 00:58:47,183
What about Tae-moo?

970
00:59:07,549 --> 00:59:14,175
