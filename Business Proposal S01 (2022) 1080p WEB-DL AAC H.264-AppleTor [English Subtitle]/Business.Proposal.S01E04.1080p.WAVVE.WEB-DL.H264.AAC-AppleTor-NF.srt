BUSINESS PROPOSAL

2
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,910
-What are you doing?
-Well, I…

3
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:20,579
-Hey.
-We'll have to delay

4
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:21,705
the meeting by an hour.

5
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,834
Mr. Go got into a minor car accident
on his way here.

6
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:28,003
-Really? Delay it, then.
-Yes, sir.

7
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:40,724
It's because I have a stye on my eye.

8
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,476
Aren't you going to press a floor?

9
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,603
Oh, right.

10
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,488
Let's attend the tasting event
for the new product lineup then.

11
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:55,406
Yes, sir.

12
00:00:58,534 --> 00:00:59,410
The tasting event?

13
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:00,786
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 1

14
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:02,079
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 2

15
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,122
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 3

16
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:05,916
Please give us your honest feedback.
Thank you.

17
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,627
-We're Team One.
-We'd really appreciate some feedback.

18
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,379
-Thank you very much.
-Here.

19
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:12,256
-Please fill out a feedback form.
-Sure.

20
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,924
We're Team One.

21
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,300
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

22
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:16,301
Thank you.

23
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:18,929
-We're Team One.
-Take it easy.

24
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:22,850
Chef Lee, you're working so hard
when the other chefs aren't even here.

25
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:26,353
The other chefs are quite experienced,
but this is a first for me.

26
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:32,818
We're Team One.
This is white kimchi ravioli.

27
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:34,653
The president is here.

28
00:01:34,737 --> 00:01:36,947
-Welcome, President Kang.
-He's so hot!

29
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:38,240
Thank you all for your hard work.

30
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:39,992
President Kang, how are you?

31
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:42,745
Sir, you should have told us
that you were coming.

32
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,582
You should always be prepared.

33
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:53,797
Sir, Team One is always prepared.
Even our chef is here today.

34
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,257
-Is that so?
-Yes, sir.

35
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,510
Let me introduce him to you.
This is Chef Lee Min-woo from M Kitchen.

36
00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:01,555
He developed
the white kimchi ravioli with us.

37
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:03,348
I'm Kang Tae-moo.

38
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:05,851
Nice to meet you.

39
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:09,980
Ta-da!

40
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:11,690
Is this the white kimchi ravioli?

41
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:12,649
Yes, sir.

42
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,903
Please give it a try, sir.

43
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:35,881
Chef Lee.

44
00:02:36,882 --> 00:02:38,634
You don't have a good eye for things.

45
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:39,551
Pardon?

46
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:41,720
I heard this was for staff meals.

47
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:44,681
Why didn't you put something
this delicious on the menu?

48
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:50,229
That's what you meant?

49
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:53,190
That was hilarious, sir.

50
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,234
It was something I had whipped together.

51
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:57,986
But thanks to Ha-ri,
it's our signature dish now.

52
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,030
Right. I read Ms. Shin's proposal.

53
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:02,616
I could feel her deep trust in you,
Chef Lee.

54
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:05,285
The two have been good friends
since college, so…

55
00:03:05,828 --> 00:03:06,703
I think

56
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,082
that's why they worked together so well.

57
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:11,125
Yes, that's right.

58
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,919
Come to think of it, I don't see Ms. Shin.

59
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:20,843
<i>Ms. Shin, is your stomach okay?
Do you want me to buy you some medicine?</i>

60
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,513
<i>No, I'm all right now.</i>

61
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:27,182
<i>Hey, how are people
reacting to our ravioli?</i>

62
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,517
<i>Are they saying it's good?</i>

63
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,941
Nobody's responding to me.

64
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,863
Mr. Kang should have left by now.
Should I go back inside?

65
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:43,365
Did you see President Kang? He's so hot.

66
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:46,410
That chef was handsome too.
Was his name Lee Min-woo?

67
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:50,122
Right. But the white kimchi ravioli?

68
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:52,291
It was my first time trying it,
but I liked it.

69
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:55,085
Me too. I think it was
the best dish there.

70
00:04:02,426 --> 00:04:05,220
Your bruise is getting worse.
Do you want something to put on it?

71
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:07,347
Don't you know me? I'd rather just eat.

72
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:08,265
I'll be fine.

73
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:12,936
Oh, right. What are people
saying about the tasting?

74
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,481
Everyone said the food was good,
but I'm not sure if they meant it.

75
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:19,359
Trust me. The guys at my company
don't sugarcoat things.

76
00:04:19,443 --> 00:04:20,444
They're really picky.

77
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,280
They say it's perfect, taste-wise.

78
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:27,409
Now it just needs some fine-tuning
as we commercialize it.

79
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:29,453
Just leave things to me, Chef Lee.

80
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:32,873
Then I'll do just that, Ms. Shin.

81
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:35,792
Oh, right!

82
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,711
Where's your review?

83
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:38,795
What review?

84
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,382
Of the concert you went to.
Yoo-ra was wondering, too.

85
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:45,177
How was it? Did you have fun?

86
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:47,429
Yes, I had fun.

87
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:51,266
Man, I was hoping you would go with a guy.

88
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,559
I bet you went with Young-seo.

89
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:53,560
I went with a guy.

90
00:04:54,937 --> 00:04:55,979
Really?

91
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:56,897
Who?

92
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:01,610
Just someone I got to know by chance.

93
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:04,821
You never told me you were seeing someone.

94
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:07,658
Do you even know what kind of guy he is?

95
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,743
Yes, well…

96
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:13,455
You're too naive
to even get a good read on guys.

97
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,082
Bring him with you sometime, will you?

98
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:17,084
I'll take a look at him for you.

99
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,378
I can take care of myself, Min-woo.

100
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:22,339
So take care of your girlfriend now,
instead of your friends.

101
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,133
You two got back together
after breaking up.

102
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:26,718
Pay more attention to her.

103
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:32,224
Why is Young-seo so late?

104
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:40,732
She's so impatient!

105
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:42,359
I'm here.

106
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:49,282
He looks a lot like the guy
who lives next door.

107
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:53,495
Wait!

108
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:55,914
That <i>is</i> him!

109
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:02,421
YOUNG-SEO

110
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,511
It's President Kang!

111
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:10,971
Sir.

112
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,890
Hello. I didn't know you were coming.

113
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:18,061
After the tasting event, I was even
more curious about your cooking, Chef Lee.

114
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,230
I'm glad you came, then.

115
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,274
I'll whip up something delicious for you.

116
00:06:22,357 --> 00:06:24,192
Just as expected, this place is popular.

117
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:26,987
Please, have a seat. This way.

118
00:06:30,532 --> 00:06:32,951
Oh, right, Ha-ri is here too.

119
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:37,622
That's weird.

120
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:39,708
She was just here a minute ago.

121
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:41,918
Why don't you have a seat?

122
00:06:57,017 --> 00:07:02,356
<i>You'd get sick of me
If we spent all of our days together</i>

123
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,273
<i>I, too…</i>

124
00:07:08,737 --> 00:07:09,821
Hello.

125
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:11,448
Where are you, Ha-ri?

126
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,950
Oh, apparently there's a big group
at the chicken shop.

127
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,078
I think Young-seo and I
need to go help out.

128
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:18,497
Hey!

129
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,166
Okay!

130
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:23,877
Yes, okay. See you!

131
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,254
Hold on,

132
00:07:26,338 --> 00:07:30,092
so the handsome guy you saw
at the convenience store is Secretary Cha?

133
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:33,136
-Yes.
-And Mr. Cha lives right next door?

134
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,388
Yes.

135
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,642
-Just how do you meet someone like that?
-That's what I'm saying.

136
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,853
Hey, you don't think
I'll run into him here too, do you?

137
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:47,442
This is driving me nuts.

138
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:51,196
Just, don't even think about
coming to my apartment for the time being.

139
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,156
Or dress up as Shin Geum-hui if you do.

140
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,449
It's <i>you</i> who needs to be careful.

141
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:59,079
Don't get all friendly with him and blab
that Shin Ha-ri is actually Shin Geum-hui.

142
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:02,666
I don't think I'll talk to him again.

143
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,751
So don't worry about that.

144
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:06,044
-Why?
-Well…

145
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:10,006
You know how Tae-moo's family and mine are
on bad terms because of the blind date?

146
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,760
So he said he doesn't want to
get involved with me, either.

147
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:16,138
-What?
-Seriously!

148
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:18,974
He definitely liked me at first.

149
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:21,101
No, really!

150
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:23,395
Hey. You don't believe me?

151
00:08:24,646 --> 00:08:27,232
Wait, what if Tae-moo bad-mouthed me

152
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:29,985
and told Mr. Cha to avoid me
because I'm completely nuts?

153
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:31,778
That petty archaeopteryx.

154
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:35,824
No, no. I don't think President Kang is
the type to talk badly about other people.

155
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:37,868
He looks a bit cold-hearted,

156
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,829
but he has a considerate side to him too.

157
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:44,374
Why are you taking Kang Tae-moo's side?
That's suspicious.

158
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,834
It's not. It's just--

159
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:49,588
You and this supposedly fake relationship,
yet you even went to a concert together.

160
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:50,797
Have you fallen for him?

161
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:51,840
It's not like that.

162
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:54,426
It's just, I didn't know
when I saw him from a distance,

163
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:58,346
but now that I've seen him up-close,
you know, he's not that bad.

164
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,265
You know, that's all it is…

165
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:01,475
Really?

166
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:04,186
-Is that really all there is to it?
-Yes!

167
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:05,770
That's enough. Let's just order.

168
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:11,526
-How was your meal?
-I think I know now.

169
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,447
Why Ms. Shin says your food
tastes cheerful and happy, Chef Lee.

170
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,656
I agree.

171
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,117
Thank you. Ha-ri is always
generous with my food.

172
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:20,535
You're college friends, right?

173
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:23,830
We met when we were 20,
so we've known each other for 7 years now.

174
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:27,334
And you've been just friends
this whole time?

175
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:29,252
Excuse me?

176
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,922
Oh. I apologize
if my question was too personal.

177
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,799
I just thought maybe one of you
could have developed feelings

178
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:37,719
since you've known each other
for such a long time.

179
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:50,941
I have no regrets, though.

180
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,192
I was really happy…

181
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:55,445
for those seven years.

182
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:56,780
Seven years, huh?

183
00:09:57,489 --> 00:10:00,492
Sir, when you asked Chef Lee
about his relationship with Ms. Shin,

184
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,327
was it because of something you heard?

185
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,578
What do you mean?

186
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:05,664
I overheard some of the employees talking,

187
00:10:05,747 --> 00:10:08,041
and apparently,
Ms. Shin had a crush on Chef Lee.

188
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:09,125
Is that so?

189
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:15,340
I guess there's someone else
like Ms. Shin Geum-hui too.

190
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:30,063
What now?

191
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:32,524
Did he just avoid me?

192
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,320
Excuse me!

193
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,030
Wait a second.

194
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:45,328
Am I a virus or something?
Why are you avoiding me?

195
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,206
You don't even want to take
the same elevator as me now?

196
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,416
-It's not--
-I mean.

197
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,876
how could you so openly avoid me?

198
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,879
-Do you not have any manners?
-I wasn't avoiding you.

199
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,257
It was because of this.

200
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:05,056
I thought you might be bothered
by the smell of the trash.

201
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:08,435
I was mistaken, then. I'm sorry.

202
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:10,437
Well, then.

203
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,813
Wait a second.

204
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:15,233
It's true that what I did
to President Kang was wrong.

205
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:16,776
That's why I apologized to him.

206
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,531
But that's between Mr. Kang and me.
It doesn't have anything to do with you.

207
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,410
Since we're already in this position,
even if we can't be friends,

208
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,496
can't we be cool and say hi
when we run into each other?

209
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,003
I'm sorry.
I've never been a "cool" person.

210
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,887
He's stomping on my pride.

211
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,433
Is he President Kang's younger brother
or something?

212
00:11:48,516 --> 00:11:50,435
Why is he so damn loyal?

213
00:11:57,776 --> 00:12:01,613
Yes, sir, I've just arrived.
I'll go right up. Yes, sir.

214
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:17,105
TRUE LIGHT FOUNDATION FOR SOCIAL WELFARE
TRUE LIGHT CHILDREN'S HOME

215
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:22,861
What are you doing here?

216
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:25,738
Just looking.

217
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,116
You've left this place exactly as it was.

218
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:29,826
Of course.

219
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,704
My grandfather really
wants you to move back in.

220
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,749
So do I. Are you really not going to?

221
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,460
No, never.

222
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,546
I don't want to suffer
when I'm at home too.

223
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:43,465
Suffer?

224
00:13:43,548 --> 00:13:45,133
Hey, what have I ever done to you?

225
00:13:47,635 --> 00:13:53,141
How long has it been
since we all ate together like this?

226
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:55,602
This place finally feels like a home.

227
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:56,603
It really does.

228
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:57,979
Right?

229
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:02,233
Now, if I just had a granddaughter-in-law
like Ms. Geum-hui

230
00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:04,944
along with some adorable
great-grandchildren,

231
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:08,907
I'd die a happy man
even if I died tomorrow.

232
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,534
You've been saying that
ever since I turned 20.

233
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:12,660
Aren't you tired of it?

234
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:15,288
What's the point of being superrich?

235
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:19,709
All I ever do is eat by myself
in this empty house like a lonely old man.

236
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,669
Don't you know eating alone
is trendy these days?

237
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:23,963
That's why our products are selling well.

238
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:26,466
You always have to have the last word.

239
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:29,511
Either get married by the year's end,

240
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:32,555
or we're all eating here together
twice a week.

241
00:14:34,557 --> 00:14:37,352
Grandfather, twice a week is too much. My…

242
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,939
My schedule is packed and…

243
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:47,111
And my place is far away, too.

244
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:49,823
I was so tired when I got up this morning.

245
00:14:51,115 --> 00:14:56,287
Now that you mention it,
move back in, Sung-hoon.

246
00:14:56,371 --> 00:15:01,793
Look at you. You moved out
the minute you graduated from college.

247
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:06,214
Now you're acting like even having
a meal together is something so difficult.

248
00:15:06,297 --> 00:15:08,550
And you call yourselves my grandsons?

249
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,970
How's my schedule this week?

250
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,227
You're free Friday morning.
Should we schedule our next meal then?

251
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:21,354
Hey, let me look at that.

252
00:15:24,482 --> 00:15:28,528
Tae-moo, do you know
what day this Saturday is?

253
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:31,114
-What? This Saturday?
-Yes!

254
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,828
-What was that?
-What are you doing?

255
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,248
I can't believe you forgot, you punk.

256
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:42,333
How could you forget a day like that?

257
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:44,669
Look!

258
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,714
29TH
SATURDAY

259
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:50,884
PRESIDENT KANG AND MS. SHIN GEUM-HUI'S
ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY

260
00:15:54,345 --> 00:15:57,974
Will you only come to your senses
after Geum-hui dumps you again?

261
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,560
How can you forget a one-year anniversary?

262
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:04,397
You bastard. You little brat.

263
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,235
Look at you, I bet you'd even forget to
show up at my funeral.

264
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:11,487
How could you say something like that?

265
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,947
It's not that I forgot--

266
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:14,365
Then?

267
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:16,659
Why did you schedule something else
on that day?

268
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,245
I told you, that's…

269
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:20,371
Cancel everything.

270
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,500
Cancel everything and schedule
a date with Ms. Geum-hui.

271
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,377
I'll make a reservation for you.

272
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:29,088
Go on, you.

273
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,180
Manager Oh! It's me, Da-goo.

274
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:41,559
I'm sorry. I had marked it on the calendar
just in case the chairman asked.

275
00:16:42,185 --> 00:16:44,771
What should we do?
Your schedule that day is tight.

276
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,108
No, we can always move things around.

277
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,115
He's okay with changing his schedule?

278
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,125
NAMHAE

279
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:11,631
Gosh, what are you doing?

280
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:14,217
That's like putting lipstick on a pig.

281
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,678
It might not make me more handsome,

282
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:19,138
but at least
I can make myself look average.

283
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,017
They're filming
the entire research process

284
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:25,311
to upload it
on the company's YouTube account.

285
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:28,815
This is the least I can do,
don't you think?

286
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:33,361
Maybe I should have gotten
my hair and makeup done too.

287
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:34,570
It's fine.

288
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,197
They'll be mainly focused on the chefs.

289
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,367
Researchers like us
will barely be in the shot.

290
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:46,874
We're here. Let's all get off the bus.

291
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,001
Let's get off.

292
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:49,669
Okay.

293
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,629
Move.

294
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:55,425
-That way.
-Okay.

295
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,759
Thank you.

296
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,262
Gosh, I'm nervous.

297
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,682
This is so nice.

298
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,644
Thank you.

299
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:07,937
What's with all the bags?

300
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,272
This way.

301
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,982
Oh, this looks like a nice spot.

302
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:12,442
Here.

303
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,780
-You can put those bags here.
-Oh, sure.

304
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:23,077
Can you check that we packed
the right number of lab coats?

305
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:28,666
There's no view quite like this
in all the eight provinces of Korea.

306
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,918
It's perfect for de-stressing.

307
00:18:31,836 --> 00:18:34,297
For sure. You have this sweeping farmland,

308
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,091
with those vast mountains as a backdrop,
and the ocean beyond that.

309
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:40,553
It's a shame that we don't have
anyone else to share this view with.

310
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:43,973
Stop beating around the bush
and give it to me straight.

311
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,349
What are you saying?

312
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:49,562
Chairman Kang, why don't we just bulldoze
all of this and build a resort here?

313
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:54,108
A resort?

314
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:55,318
Look at the land here.

315
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:58,446
All we're doing with it
is commercial farming.

316
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:01,032
Imagine a golf course here

317
00:19:01,115 --> 00:19:02,867
and a ski resort
by the mountains over there.

318
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,870
We could fill the whole place up
with our subsidiary franchises.

319
00:19:05,953 --> 00:19:08,081
Wouldn't that be something?

320
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:11,667
Why is that idea skipping over
President Kang and coming straight to me?

321
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:15,588
We submitted a business proposal,
but he shot it down almost immediately.

322
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,590
Is that so?

323
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:20,510
President Kang is still young
and inexperienced,

324
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,179
so he can't make
a bold move like you'd do.

325
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,932
He's not interested in long-term plans
with guaranteed profits like this.

326
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:28,851
All he does is play house with his chefs.

327
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,313
So, if you were to directly suggest, sir--

328
00:19:32,396 --> 00:19:36,484
You! Do you want President Kang
to fire you too?

329
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:37,693
Sir?

330
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:42,698
You've been buying
the land here bit by bit.

331
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,450
Didn't you think I'd know?

332
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:47,662
Chairman Kang, that's not--

333
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:49,997
It seems to me
like you're trying to make a buck

334
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:52,333
by raising the real estate
prices around here.

335
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,544
Stop it with your ridiculous ideas

336
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:58,714
and just support President Kang
as he plays house!

337
00:19:59,924 --> 00:20:02,552
Chairman Kang,
this is all a misunderstanding.

338
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:08,599
All they ever do is try to find ways
to fill their own pockets.

339
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:15,022
Hold on. Stop the car.

340
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,943
<i>Here are the premium ingredients…</i>

341
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:27,660
<i>That go food product researchers
have picked from the farm themselves…</i>

342
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:34,292
<i>To present to the chef!</i>

343
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,543
Oh wait, it's that way.

344
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:38,212
Cut!

345
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,339
-Hey, Jeong-hwan.
-Yes, sir.

346
00:20:40,423 --> 00:20:41,841
-Jeong-hwan!
-Yes, I'm coming!

347
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,468
What's with the actor?

348
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:46,304
Wasn't I quite good?

349
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:48,014
-It was a bit awkward.
-Okay.

350
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:49,473
Do I need to put more into it?

351
00:20:49,557 --> 00:20:53,227
How can you mess up a line
this short, over ten times?

352
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:56,772
What was the point of the makeup?
Your acting is still crap.

353
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,194
It's just because I'm camera shy.

354
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:02,987
Are you taking more calming pills?

355
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,906
He knows that's not candy, right?

356
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:09,243
If Ms. Shin's eye wasn't like that,
we would have switched you out right away.

357
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,831
Whatever! It's not like
we're filming an epic here.

358
00:21:13,915 --> 00:21:16,918
I can take care of myself,
so don't you worry about a thing!

359
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:19,587
Don't say such stupid things!

360
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,672
All right, everybody. Stand by, please.

361
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:23,424
-Okay!
-Okay.

362
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:25,009
Oh, Ms. Shin.

363
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:26,344
Do it right!

364
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:29,222
Am I that bad?

365
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:31,432
-You got this.
-Yes, I got this.

366
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:32,725
Let's do it, everybody!

367
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:35,186
Ready, and cue!

368
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:37,897
Here are the premium ingredients…

369
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:42,985
That go food researchers
picked from the farm themselves…

370
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:49,200
To present to the chef!

371
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,086
Nice catch!

372
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,047
-Chairman Kang.
-Chairman Kang!

373
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,925
-You're all working hard, I see.
-Chairman Kang!

374
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:08,010
My gosh!

375
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,178
Be careful, there.

376
00:22:10,972 --> 00:22:12,306
Oh, here it is. Here it is.

377
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,308
Oh, come on.

378
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:17,436
Why did this thing get bigger?

379
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:20,147
Thank you.

380
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:21,065
Sure.

381
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:23,401
-Thank you.
-I'll have the chamomile.

382
00:22:23,484 --> 00:22:25,403
Chamomile is perfect for this setting.

383
00:22:25,486 --> 00:22:27,613
-I hope you enjoy it.
-Thank you.

384
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:32,827
<i>Why did he have to drive past
our shooting location?</i>

385
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,495
<i>He won't recognize me, will he?</i>

386
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:41,335
It's my first time
seeing the chairman this close.

387
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:43,587
So Ms. Yeo and Chairman Kang are close?

388
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:48,509
No, they're not close at all.
She's barely seen him this close-up.

389
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:52,221
Sucking up is all part of the job,
you know.

390
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:56,559
It's difficult to work with President Kang
because he's quite strict, isn't it?

391
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,728
Not at all.
Since he knows the entire process

392
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,730
from the ground up better than anyone,

393
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,107
communication is smooth,
and it's more rewarding.

394
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,984
You don't say?

395
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:10,531
What?

396
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:13,951
By the way,

397
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:17,788
what's this weird noise
I've been hearing for a while now?

398
00:23:17,872 --> 00:23:19,373
Oh, I think you're right.

399
00:23:19,457 --> 00:23:20,750
What a weird noise.

400
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:31,135
Hey, it looks like
somebody left their phone here.

401
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:34,638
Oh, I think this belongs
to our employee, Ms. Shin.

402
00:23:34,722 --> 00:23:35,973
Oh, really?

403
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:38,100
Ms. Shin!

404
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,811
Ms. Shin!

405
00:23:41,395 --> 00:23:42,855
-Me?
-Yes.

406
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,816
-What for?
-Come on, quickly.

407
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:48,778
What?

408
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:53,532
Come.

409
00:23:53,616 --> 00:23:55,868
You called for me?

410
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:58,788
Ms. Shin, I think this phone
belongs to you.

411
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:01,874
Oh, my. Yes, that's mine. Thank you.

412
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:04,335
Hold on, I think somebody's calling.

413
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:15,346
"Archaeopteryx?"

414
00:24:16,263 --> 00:24:17,264
ARCHAEOPTERYX

415
00:24:18,265 --> 00:24:19,308
Oh, no!

416
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:22,853
I'll give it to you
if there's any leftover.

417
00:24:22,937 --> 00:24:26,857
What's wrong with her?
She didn't even thank me.

418
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:30,611
Come on.

419
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,824
Why did he have to
pick the worst time to call me?

420
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,953
<i>Why aren't you picking up?
It's an emergency, so call me back.</i>

421
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:41,205
The situation here
is much more of an emergency!

422
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:44,333
Where am I?

423
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,251
RESTROOM

424
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:46,460
Oh, the bathroom!

425
00:24:56,887 --> 00:24:58,556
PRESIDENT KANG TAE-MOO

426
00:25:15,072 --> 00:25:15,948
Hello.

427
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:17,867
What emergency? What's going on?

428
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:20,703
Never mind that. Why didn't you pick up?

429
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:24,165
It's against company policy
to be on our phones during work hours.

430
00:25:24,248 --> 00:25:26,584
What? What kind of company does that?

431
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,377
Anyway, what is this about?

432
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,172
Would it kill you
to exchange pleasantries first?

433
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:33,757
How have you been?
How's your eye doing? And so on.

434
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:37,970
Oh, sorry. I just have a lot
going on at the moment.

435
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:39,930
My eye is fine.

436
00:25:40,014 --> 00:25:42,850
Do you know what day this Saturday is?

437
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:44,560
This Saturday?

438
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:45,728
Saturday?

439
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,938
Isn't that our fake one-year anniversary?

440
00:25:50,774 --> 00:25:53,319
You're better than me.
I'd forgotten about it.

441
00:25:53,402 --> 00:25:56,322
Well, I've always been good
at memorizing stuff, you know.

442
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:58,157
<i>What about it, though?</i>

443
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,951
My grandfather found out,
so things got a bit complicated.

444
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:04,955
Your grandfather?

445
00:26:06,457 --> 00:26:07,875
Do you want to

446
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:10,252
meet for dinner today?

447
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,173
Oh, but I'm on a business trip right now.

448
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:16,342
A business trip?

449
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:19,303
Yes, they scheduled it last minute.

450
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:21,013
That's a shame then.

451
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:23,849
Oh, and it turns out
that song is rather popular.

452
00:26:24,975 --> 00:26:26,143
What song?

453
00:26:26,227 --> 00:26:28,437
<i>The song that you've set
as your ringback tone.</i>

454
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,357
<i>I've been hearing it
play all over the place.</i>

455
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,361
I'll call you tomorrow, then.

456
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:36,487
Okay.

457
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:44,453
What company bans people
from picking up their phones

458
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,331
and sends an employee with an injured eye
on a business trip?

459
00:26:52,503 --> 00:26:56,382
Sir, are you feeling all right?
You're sweating all of a sudden.

460
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,550
No, it's…

461
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:01,220
My stomach is…

462
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:05,099
Oh, maybe it's because
you suddenly had cold food. I can…

463
00:27:05,182 --> 00:27:07,559
I'll get you something warm.

464
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:10,312
Well, instead of that

465
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:13,565
I just want to go to the bathroom.

466
00:27:14,858 --> 00:27:15,985
My goodness.

467
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,029
Hello, sir.

468
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:22,658
It's an honor to have you here, sir.

469
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:26,120
I woke up this morning
knowing today would be “eye-opening.”

470
00:27:26,203 --> 00:27:28,455
"Eye-opening"?

471
00:27:29,498 --> 00:27:31,083
Oh, man, my stomach.

472
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,377
Yes, sir! “Waking up” is “eye-opening.”

473
00:27:34,795 --> 00:27:36,255
"Eye-opening…"

474
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:41,260
You've been a big inspiration to me, sir!
I used to be afraid of hurdles in life,

475
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:43,804
but I “got over” them! Salute!

476
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:48,434
You're a bit young to be making
dad jokes. Even I don't do those.

477
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:50,352
God, my stomach.

478
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:52,104
If you thought this was the end,

479
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:53,772
you're wrong!

480
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:55,357
Wrong.

481
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:57,985
Listen, my stomach hurts.

482
00:27:59,737 --> 00:28:02,948
I have a few more jokes about

483
00:28:03,907 --> 00:28:07,494
how I'm not unemployed thanks to you, sir,

484
00:28:07,578 --> 00:28:09,455
but none of them "work"!

485
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:11,665
Oh, my stomach.

486
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:15,085
Hey, I've got a joke about construction,
but I'm still "working on it."

487
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:18,047
Where can I find a bathroom around here?

488
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,926
So my ringback tone was still that song?

489
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,762
I'd forgotten about it.

490
00:28:25,262 --> 00:28:27,556
But how do I cancel this?

491
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,391
-Oh, man.
-Right this way, sir.

492
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,644
Why is it so far?

493
00:28:31,727 --> 00:28:32,811
Here…

494
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:35,731
Wait! One second, sir.

495
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:39,860
Ms. Shin! That's you in there, right?

496
00:28:39,943 --> 00:28:43,113
I saw you running over here.
Make it quick and come out, okay?

497
00:28:43,197 --> 00:28:44,990
Okay, I'm coming out.

498
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:48,160
Okay. Sir, your bathroom is ready.

499
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:50,663
Then good luck with your number two, sir.

500
00:28:50,746 --> 00:28:51,622
To healthy bowels!

501
00:28:58,087 --> 00:29:01,173
Hey, look here.
Why did you go back inside?

502
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:04,134
-Hey!
-What do I do?

503
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,055
For God's sake. There's only one stall.

504
00:29:08,138 --> 00:29:10,432
-What do I do? Oh, my stomach.
-Damn it.

505
00:29:11,475 --> 00:29:12,935
This is bad.

506
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,814
Hey, I really need to go.

507
00:29:16,897 --> 00:29:19,108
Could you hurry up a bit?

508
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:20,109
Look here!

509
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,737
Jeez, at least give me an answer!

510
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:25,531
What do I do?

511
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:30,285
This won't do.

512
00:29:30,994 --> 00:29:34,081
-One, two, three!
-Two, three!

513
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:53,517
Oh, no!

514
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,728
God, it's so cold!

515
00:29:58,313 --> 00:30:01,150
-Chairman Kang!
-Why didn't you come out sooner?

516
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:03,444
Are you all right, Mr. Kang?

517
00:30:03,527 --> 00:30:05,571
-What's this noise…
-It's so cold!

518
00:30:05,654 --> 00:30:07,030
Chairman Kang!

519
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:10,033
Sir! How did you end up like this, sir?

520
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:13,162
-How did this happen?
-It's so cold.

521
00:30:16,123 --> 00:30:17,207
This way.

522
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,001
This way, sir.

523
00:30:21,545 --> 00:30:24,631
I might as well be
wearing shorts right now.

524
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:25,924
It's cold.

525
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:26,842
I'm sorry, sir.

526
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,177
Oh, my.

527
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:34,683
It's fine.

528
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:38,312
I'm so sorry, Chairman. Please forgive us.

529
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:39,646
There's no need for that.

530
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,607
Good luck with the rest of the shoot.

531
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,108
Well, then.

532
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,157
Let's go.

533
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,283
Yes, sir.

534
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,414
-Take care.
-Yes, sir.

535
00:30:57,498 --> 00:30:58,457
Goodbye, sir.

536
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,458
Take care.

537
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:00,542
Yes, sir!

538
00:31:01,043 --> 00:31:04,338
I hope your new pants are comfortable!
I'm Associate Director Gye!

539
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,930
Ms. Shin, you should have been
more careful!

540
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:14,056
I'm sorry.

541
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:17,267
-Be careful yourself, Mr. Gye.
-What do you mean?

542
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:19,394
I think you're revealing
too much of yourself.

543
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:25,025
Before launching
"A Collaboration With the Chef,"

544
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:28,570
we are planning to put together videos
of interviews with the chefs

545
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:32,199
alongside the manufacturing process and
upload it to our social media platforms.

546
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:34,409
It's the researchers' shoot today, right?

547
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:35,744
Yes, sir.

548
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:39,248
We received a portion of the footage.
Would you like to take a look?

549
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:41,333
Sure.

550
00:31:46,463 --> 00:31:49,091
<i>Here are the premium ingredients…</i>

551
00:31:51,301 --> 00:31:54,096
<i>That go food researchers
picked from the farm themselves…</i>

552
00:31:57,432 --> 00:32:00,811
<i>To present to the chef!</i>

553
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:06,859
Would you like to watch
some behind-the-scenes footage as well?

554
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,280
<i>To present to the chef!</i>

555
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:16,827
<i>Cut! That was good. Let's do another take.</i>

556
00:32:17,953 --> 00:32:21,331
<i>Ms. Shin, you don't need to keep
catching the cabbage.</i>

557
00:32:21,415 --> 00:32:23,625
<i>I don't want it to fall and go bad.</i>

558
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,461
<i>A food researcher
should care about the ingredients.</i>

559
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:29,089
We should use
this behind-the-scenes video.

560
00:32:29,172 --> 00:32:30,924
Yes, I will, sir.

561
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:33,218
<i>Come on, get it right!</i>

562
00:32:34,803 --> 00:32:35,762
Yes, sir.

563
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:37,556
<i>Let's go again!</i>

564
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:39,266
What?

565
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:50,485
Excuse me.

566
00:32:51,486 --> 00:32:53,322
That's my mailbox.

567
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:57,993
Oh, hello. I live in unit 622.

568
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:01,371
I took your mail by mistake.

569
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,624
I'M SORRY
I TOOK YOUR MAIL BY MISTAKE

570
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:07,836
Sorry. If you're offended, I apologize.

571
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,962
No, it's okay.

572
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:14,468
It's human to make mistakes sometimes.

573
00:33:14,551 --> 00:33:16,553
You apologized, so it's fine.

574
00:33:16,637 --> 00:33:18,639
Because I'm cool like that.

575
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:21,892
Thank you for understanding.

576
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:25,687
-You moved here just recently, didn't you?
-Yes, how did you know?

577
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:28,899
Oh, I saw your furniture going in,

578
00:33:28,982 --> 00:33:31,151
and you have a great taste in furniture.

579
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:33,487
You must like vintage products.

580
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,322
Oh, yes, well…

581
00:33:35,405 --> 00:33:39,284
I'm actually a furniture designer,
so I couldn't help but take a peek.

582
00:33:39,368 --> 00:33:42,412
You can tell a lot about a person
by looking at their furniture.

583
00:33:42,496 --> 00:33:44,206
You're a designer?

584
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:48,043
After meeting like this,
let's not be strangers.

585
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,754
Sure. I can always say hi to my neighbors.

586
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:04,267
Look at that inconsiderate bastard.

587
00:34:04,351 --> 00:34:07,104
Even with his grandfather in this state.

588
00:34:07,854 --> 00:34:11,024
The hospital says you need to watch out
for just one thing.

589
00:34:11,108 --> 00:34:13,610
What? What is it? What's wrong with me?

590
00:34:14,194 --> 00:34:16,947
-The fact you're a hypochondriac.
-You little!

591
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,617
Even the CT scan says you're just fine.
Why are you being a crybaby?

592
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:22,285
I am not!

593
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,372
Do you know how hard I fell

594
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:28,375
because Shin Ha-ri, or Shin Na-ri,
or whatever her name is,

595
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:31,211
didn't bother to catch an old man
as he was falling over?

596
00:34:31,294 --> 00:34:35,716
I'm sure Ms. Shin didn't do it on purpose.
I like her. She's good at her job.

597
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:37,884
Why would you like her?

598
00:34:37,968 --> 00:34:42,472
Her hair was all messed up like this,
like she was a ghost or something.

599
00:34:42,556 --> 00:34:44,057
That was a wig, right?

600
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:46,518
Anyway, I don't like her.

601
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:48,228
Is she shy?

602
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:51,857
But our Geum-hui is totally different,
isn't she?

603
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,943
She's around her age,
but look how bright and quick she is.

604
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:57,070
How nice is that?

605
00:34:57,821 --> 00:35:00,699
Where should we send
the medicine that you requested, sir?

606
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,744
Oh, yes, about that…

607
00:35:05,287 --> 00:35:06,913
What's Geum-hui's address?

608
00:35:08,123 --> 00:35:09,166
What?

609
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:24,626
-Hello?
<i>-Are you back from your business trip?</i>

610
00:35:25,252 --> 00:35:27,421
Oh, yes. I just got back home.

611
00:35:27,504 --> 00:35:31,300
That's good. I'm in front of your house.
Can I see you for a moment?

612
00:35:31,383 --> 00:35:33,886
You're in front of my house? Wait, why…

613
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:37,598
Where?

614
00:35:38,974 --> 00:35:41,018
<i>I have something for you.
It won't take long.</i>

615
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,191
I'm so sorry, but I don't think
I can go out right now.

616
00:35:48,275 --> 00:35:49,276
Really?

617
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:51,695
Then should I leave it at the shop?

618
00:35:51,778 --> 00:35:52,905
At the shop?

619
00:35:52,988 --> 00:35:55,782
No! Don't do that.

620
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,126
Did you wait long?

621
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,546
Who…

622
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:17,471
No. But what are you wearing?

623
00:36:18,055 --> 00:36:20,515
This? I told my family
that I was going on a delivery.

624
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,226
In case they ask me
who I was going to meet.

625
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,896
I can't tell them
I'm meeting my fake boyfriend.

626
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:26,855
1. TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT

627
00:36:26,939 --> 00:36:27,898
2. THERE ISN'T ANYONE
WHO RECOGNIZES ME, RIGHT?

628
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:28,899
3. MAN… THIS IS EMBARRASSING…

629
00:36:28,982 --> 00:36:29,942
4. I'M IN SUCH A PICKLE…

630
00:36:30,025 --> 00:36:31,944
Sorry, I didn't think that through.

631
00:36:32,778 --> 00:36:34,363
I just wanted to give this to you.

632
00:36:37,741 --> 00:36:38,784
What is this?

633
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:41,954
My grandpa went to a clinic
and ordered this special tonic.

634
00:36:42,037 --> 00:36:43,497
Was he injured that badly?

635
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,790
What?

636
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:50,003
How did you know that he was injured?

637
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:53,423
GRANDPA, PAIN, CLINIC, TONIC

638
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:55,717
What? Well, I mean…

639
00:36:57,302 --> 00:37:01,682
You said that he went to a clinic,
so I thought that maybe he got hurt?

640
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:06,353
He had a light fall,
but he tends to overreact.

641
00:37:06,436 --> 00:37:09,064
Oh, okay.
Please tell him thank you for me.

642
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,859
And…

643
00:37:15,028 --> 00:37:18,865
I picked up some ointment on the way here.
It's supposed to be good for bruises.

644
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:19,783
Use this.

645
00:37:22,494 --> 00:37:25,747
Oh, you really didn't have to do this.

646
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:26,665
IS HE WORRIED ABOUT ME?

647
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:27,958
Thank you.

648
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:30,002
Oh, wait, I have something too!

649
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,006
Here.

650
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:35,841
Fried chicken?

651
00:37:35,924 --> 00:37:39,636
I couldn't come out to deliver chicken
without bringing chicken, right?

652
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,263
Go eat it with your grandfather.

653
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:42,848
Our chicken is really good.

654
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:47,144
They're looking for me back at the store.

655
00:37:47,227 --> 00:37:50,105
I'm going to go, then.
I'll see you this weekend.

656
00:38:06,204 --> 00:38:08,081
Oh, my. Look at all this.

657
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:12,377
I thought he was just cold.

658
00:38:13,462 --> 00:38:14,379
OINTMENT

659
00:38:14,463 --> 00:38:16,673
But he has a sweet side to him too.

660
00:38:23,513 --> 00:38:27,184
I went to see her face
to check if her bruise was okay.

661
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:28,477
What?

662
00:38:29,186 --> 00:38:31,521
Why do I care if he's sweet or not?

663
00:38:31,605 --> 00:38:32,731
Whatever.

664
00:38:40,238 --> 00:38:41,198
Stop it!

665
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,226
Your eye looks completely healed now.

666
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:12,479
Oh, yeah. The ointment that you gave me
was really effective.

667
00:39:12,562 --> 00:39:13,730
That's good to hear.

668
00:39:14,314 --> 00:39:16,358
But where are we going right now?

669
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:19,569
It is our one-year anniversary after all,
so somewhere nice.

670
00:39:25,492 --> 00:39:31,790
<i>BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI</i>

671
00:39:31,873 --> 00:39:33,041
Are you stupid, Geum-hui?

672
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,085
Do you not have a mouth?

673
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:38,004
Why can't you just say
that I'm the man you love?

674
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:41,967
How can I say that
looking like this, Gwang-bok?

675
00:39:44,386 --> 00:39:46,429
I want to buy all of this,
from here to here.

676
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:49,599
How much? How much do you need?

677
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,603
<i>Hey, you have those clothes too, honey.</i>

678
00:39:53,687 --> 00:39:54,980
<i>What do you mean?</i>

679
00:39:55,063 --> 00:39:57,482
<i>Why would you display
clothes that are out of stock?</i>

680
00:39:58,942 --> 00:40:01,820
I'm right! The clothes that I bought you.

681
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:04,281
It's exactly what Geum-hui is wearing!

682
00:40:04,364 --> 00:40:06,867
Anyway, that TV show makes no sense.

683
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,369
What kind of rich guy
buys his girlfriend a t-shirt

684
00:40:09,452 --> 00:40:10,662
that's only 15,000 won?

685
00:40:10,745 --> 00:40:12,372
That's all just advertisements.

686
00:40:12,455 --> 00:40:15,834
They just film the show at any store
that's willing to sponsor them.

687
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:17,127
Young-seo said so.

688
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:20,172
Anyway, Geum-hui is so lucky.

689
00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:23,049
Gwang-bok buys her
the entire store and everything.

690
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:26,136
I heard that Man-sik,
the guy who used to follow me around,

691
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:28,263
runs his own company now.

692
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:34,561
I'm sorry.

693
00:40:34,644 --> 00:40:38,190
If only I had hidden
my love for you back then,

694
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:41,193
you wouldn't be living like this.

695
00:40:46,364 --> 00:40:48,617
By the way, where did Ha-ri go again?

696
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:51,369
She's been going out every weekend.

697
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:54,623
-Maybe she's dating someone.
-Dating, my ass.

698
00:40:54,706 --> 00:40:55,999
It's obvious.

699
00:40:56,082 --> 00:40:58,084
She's probably with Young-seo,

700
00:40:58,168 --> 00:41:00,337
chatting away and acting all pitiful.

701
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:07,969
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

702
00:41:10,597 --> 00:41:12,098
This way, please.

703
00:41:26,196 --> 00:41:27,447
It smells really good.

704
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:47,050
Let's see this, this,
and everything from here to here.

705
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:48,218
Yes, sir.

706
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,934
What's with the cliché lines and vibe?

707
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:57,978
I think you've seen way too many TV shows.

708
00:41:58,061 --> 00:42:00,438
Not me. It's my grandfather
who's seen too many.

709
00:42:00,522 --> 00:42:01,648
What?

710
00:42:01,731 --> 00:42:03,984
If we don't do this, he'll hear about it.

711
00:42:05,193 --> 00:42:07,862
So do your best.
As if this is real, not fake.

712
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:21,418
Can you try on another one?

713
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:36,016
-We'll take a look at this one, too.
-Yes, sir.

714
00:42:38,852 --> 00:42:40,562
How about this skirt?

715
00:43:07,922 --> 00:43:09,924
I like this one.
What do you think, Geum-hui?

716
00:43:10,008 --> 00:43:11,134
I like it too.

717
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:16,014
You have an excellent eye, sir.
Let me help you with your payment.

718
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:21,269
Do you have a bigger size?
I can't zip this up.

719
00:43:21,353 --> 00:43:23,730
This is the only piece
in the country right now.

720
00:43:25,273 --> 00:43:28,568
I'd say this fits very well, ma'am.

721
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:29,486
Really?

722
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,202
It's so damn expensive,
yet so damn stingy with the fabric.

723
00:43:38,411 --> 00:43:39,871
I have a bad feeling about this.

724
00:43:40,497 --> 00:43:41,915
Shall we go?

725
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:52,217
Hello. Long time, no see.

726
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,218
Oh, my god!

727
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:56,096
Ms. Jo! It's been so long
since we last saw you!

728
00:43:56,179 --> 00:43:59,724
I need a dress to wear
to the Founding Anniversary Ceremony.

729
00:43:59,808 --> 00:44:01,434
Then why don't you take your time--

730
00:44:01,518 --> 00:44:02,394
Stop!

731
00:44:02,477 --> 00:44:03,561
Never mind that.

732
00:44:05,605 --> 00:44:06,689
Kim Se-jeong.

733
00:44:07,315 --> 00:44:10,902
The dress that actress wore to
the press conference for her new show.

734
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:14,364
Only one of them has been imported
to South Korea.

735
00:44:14,447 --> 00:44:15,365
Where is it?

736
00:44:15,448 --> 00:44:17,200
I'm afraid it was just sold.

737
00:44:17,283 --> 00:44:18,910
What? To who?

738
00:44:19,661 --> 00:44:21,162
Over there…

739
00:44:27,585 --> 00:44:29,254
Thank you.

740
00:44:29,337 --> 00:44:30,588
That's Kang Tae-moo.

741
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,345
Who's the girl next to him?

742
00:44:48,189 --> 00:44:51,860
<i>Protect your skin
before time leaves a mark.</i>

743
00:44:51,943 --> 00:44:54,070
Cut! That was good.

744
00:44:54,154 --> 00:44:57,532
Sir, let us touch up her hair and makeup
before the next shot.

745
00:44:57,615 --> 00:44:59,325
Okay, let's do that.

746
00:44:59,409 --> 00:45:00,285
Could you…

747
00:45:01,494 --> 00:45:04,831
Could you touch up her hair
and blot some of the oil from her face?

748
00:45:04,914 --> 00:45:06,040
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thanks.

749
00:45:06,124 --> 00:45:09,252
Hello, my babies.

750
00:45:09,335 --> 00:45:11,462
Okay.

751
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,424
Ms. Jin.

752
00:45:15,425 --> 00:45:16,593
What are you doing?

753
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:21,261
-Aren't you going to greet your director?
-Oh, Director Jo, I'm sorry.

754
00:45:21,848 --> 00:45:23,016
I didn't recognize you

755
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:26,978
because your face changes so much
every time I see you.

756
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:30,231
Did you touch up your forehead this time?

757
00:45:30,315 --> 00:45:33,193
What do you mean?
I didn't "touch up" anything!

758
00:45:34,235 --> 00:45:36,696
Don't you know that
I am a natural-born beauty?

759
00:45:37,447 --> 00:45:38,573
Yu-jeong, if you're…

760
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:41,910
I mean, Director Jo,
if you're a natural-born beauty,

761
00:45:41,993 --> 00:45:44,454
then is <i>ramyeon</i> an organic, superfood?

762
00:45:44,537 --> 00:45:46,331
-Hey!
-What?

763
00:45:47,207 --> 00:45:48,666
-Ma'am.
-Fine.

764
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,379
You seem to think you can act up
because of your dad.

765
00:45:53,463 --> 00:45:55,215
But at work, I'm your boss.

766
00:45:55,298 --> 00:45:58,009
I won't go easy on you
just because you're my cousin.

767
00:46:00,386 --> 00:46:03,348
Then again, I'm sorry.
I'll be the bigger person.

768
00:46:03,431 --> 00:46:08,353
You must be so stressed
because you were rejected by Kang Tae-moo.

769
00:46:08,436 --> 00:46:09,562
Oh, my mistake.

770
00:46:10,355 --> 00:46:12,232
What did you just say?

771
00:46:12,315 --> 00:46:14,400
Kang Tae-moo.

772
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:16,861
Apparently, he has a girlfriend.

773
00:46:16,945 --> 00:46:19,822
Her hair and eye makeup were stunning.

774
00:46:19,906 --> 00:46:22,242
She was so much prettier than you.

775
00:46:22,325 --> 00:46:25,161
I just saw them shopping at a boutique.

776
00:46:25,245 --> 00:46:27,330
with my very own eyes.

777
00:46:28,373 --> 00:46:29,999
Goodness, Director Jo!

778
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:32,502
Your employees are working
hard on the weekend

779
00:46:32,585 --> 00:46:34,671
to shoot this commercial,

780
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:38,633
but you went shopping?
When you should be setting an example?

781
00:46:41,511 --> 00:46:42,512
No.

782
00:46:43,054 --> 00:46:45,098
No, that's not what I…

783
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:48,726
I just stopped by
to dress properly as a director.

784
00:46:51,354 --> 00:46:53,940
For directors,
working hard is more important

785
00:46:54,023 --> 00:46:55,441
than going shopping.

786
00:46:55,525 --> 00:46:57,902
Also, if you have the time to go shopping,

787
00:46:57,986 --> 00:47:00,655
maybe you should go to
the dermatologist too.

788
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:03,032
Look at all those wrinkles
around your eyes!

789
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:04,242
They look like noodles.

790
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:07,870
Hey! Where do you see any wrinkles
on my face, huh?

791
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,165
You should really go to the dermatologist.

792
00:47:12,959 --> 00:47:16,838
It sounds like you're also
working hard today, Ms. Shin Geum-hui.

793
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:18,131
I'm sorry, Ha-ri.

794
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:27,348
That's a sample.

795
00:47:31,352 --> 00:47:35,189
This is grilled sea bass
and anchovy salad.

796
00:47:35,273 --> 00:47:38,693
It's been garnished with lotus root,
asparagus, and arugula puree. Enjoy.

797
00:47:41,904 --> 00:47:43,614
It smells so good, doesn't it?

798
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,456
You must come here often.

799
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:54,334
The chef and the staff
all seem to recognize you.

800
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,045
You came with a girlfriend, right?

801
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:02,925
Would you take your boyfriend to
the chicken shop run by your own parents?

802
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:04,886
When they'd ask endless questions?

803
00:48:05,553 --> 00:48:07,138
What are you talking about?

804
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:09,640
My grandfather owns this restaurant.

805
00:48:09,724 --> 00:48:11,184
Chairman Kang Da-goo?

806
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:13,936
Well, the chef that you just saw
is the owner on paper.

807
00:48:23,446 --> 00:48:24,906
This dish tastes quite familiar.

808
00:48:26,866 --> 00:48:29,744
That dish was developed
at this restaurant, so I doubt it.

809
00:48:29,827 --> 00:48:31,871
You know,
anchovies are fermented fish too.

810
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:34,415
Maybe it's because this is
pretty similar to <i>jeotgal</i>?

811
00:48:34,499 --> 00:48:37,543
It tastes a bit like fresh kimchi!

812
00:48:39,128 --> 00:48:41,506
You have a very accurate palate, Ms. Shin.

813
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:42,423
What?

814
00:48:42,507 --> 00:48:44,550
Actually, I made this myself.

815
00:48:46,386 --> 00:48:47,512
Really?

816
00:48:48,596 --> 00:48:51,349
I've been planning
to make kimchi more localized.

817
00:48:51,974 --> 00:48:53,810
In a country that doesn't have cabbage,

818
00:48:53,893 --> 00:48:57,480
you could make kimchi with the most
popular vegetable of that country.

819
00:48:57,563 --> 00:49:00,191
For example, making kimchi with cilantro
in Southeast Asia,

820
00:49:00,274 --> 00:49:02,693
since that's popular there.

821
00:49:02,777 --> 00:49:05,571
Or you could use anchovies
instead of fish sauce.

822
00:49:06,364 --> 00:49:07,824
It's the same fishy taste,

823
00:49:07,907 --> 00:49:10,827
but foreigners are more used
to the taste of anchovies.

824
00:49:15,456 --> 00:49:18,084
I'm sorry. I'm boring you
with all this work talk, aren't I?

825
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:21,546
No, I'm enjoying it.
I'm always interested in food.

826
00:49:24,507 --> 00:49:26,134
The food's going to get cold.

827
00:49:26,759 --> 00:49:27,635
Let's eat.

828
00:49:27,718 --> 00:49:28,636
Okay.

829
00:49:38,938 --> 00:49:42,567
It sure is nice to have a gym
right in front of my place.

830
00:49:43,943 --> 00:49:45,194
It's so big!

831
00:49:46,446 --> 00:49:47,822
Let's get started then.

832
00:49:54,537 --> 00:49:55,746
Hello.

833
00:49:57,957 --> 00:49:59,292
Oh, right.

834
00:49:59,834 --> 00:50:02,462
You said that you don't even
want to say hi to me, right?

835
00:50:02,545 --> 00:50:05,631
I'll just cancel that "hello," then.
Just pretend it never happened.

836
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:08,176
You can use it first.

837
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:16,058
That's not what I wanted.

838
00:50:17,268 --> 00:50:19,228
Oh, are you here to work out?

839
00:50:19,312 --> 00:50:21,314
Oh, hello.

840
00:50:27,278 --> 00:50:28,738
-All right, one second.
-Yes?

841
00:50:28,821 --> 00:50:29,780
It's good,

842
00:50:29,864 --> 00:50:32,575
but straighten your back a little bit.

843
00:50:33,242 --> 00:50:35,369
Breathe out as you lower it.

844
00:50:36,037 --> 00:50:38,664
Okay, let's raise it slowly now.

845
00:50:38,748 --> 00:50:39,790
-Slowly?
-Yes.

846
00:50:39,874 --> 00:50:42,502
<i>He's handsome and has good manners.</i>

847
00:50:42,585 --> 00:50:45,463
<i>And above all,
he's obviously interested in me.</i>

848
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:48,674
<i>But I'm just not feeling anything.</i>

849
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:56,349
<i>That one has no manners
and is super annoying,</i>

850
00:50:56,432 --> 00:50:58,851
<i>and on top of that,
he has zero interest in me.</i>

851
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:03,272
<i>But look at that.</i>

852
00:51:03,356 --> 00:51:05,900
<i>That's making me feel
a whole lot of different things.</i>

853
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:08,945
<i>He's totally my type.</i>

854
00:51:11,364 --> 00:51:13,824
You're a really good teacher.
No, I'm all right.

855
00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:19,872
Hello.

856
00:51:21,332 --> 00:51:22,416
Hey, what time is it?

857
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,544
I don't know. My phone's in my locker.

858
00:51:24,627 --> 00:51:25,836
It's seven past eight.

859
00:51:26,963 --> 00:51:28,297
Look over there.

860
00:51:31,926 --> 00:51:33,219
Oh, thank you.

861
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:41,561
Why is someone who can see just fine
wearing glasses?

862
00:51:42,395 --> 00:51:43,437
<i>Here, take this.</i>

863
00:51:44,647 --> 00:51:46,232
What is it?

864
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:47,650
It's a standing lamp.

865
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:51,028
I wanted to apologize
for taking your mail last time.

866
00:51:51,112 --> 00:51:53,698
No, it's okay. You didn't have to.

867
00:51:53,781 --> 00:51:56,784
This is actually
something I designed myself.

868
00:51:57,577 --> 00:51:59,662
You can just give me
some feedback in return,

869
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:01,122
so don't think too much of it.

870
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:03,374
You really didn't have to.

871
00:52:04,292 --> 00:52:05,334
Thank you.

872
00:52:11,944 --> 00:52:14,321
Why is this dress so tight?

873
00:52:14,822 --> 00:52:16,449
I didn't even get to eat properly.

874
00:52:42,766 --> 00:52:44,018
Crap, seriously?

875
00:52:55,196 --> 00:52:57,198
Congratulations on
your one-year anniversary.

876
00:53:01,285 --> 00:53:03,078
Thank you all for congratulating us.

877
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,791
Ms. Shin, shall we
blow out the candle together?

878
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:09,877
Sure.

879
00:53:11,212 --> 00:53:13,214
One, two, three.

880
00:53:26,477 --> 00:53:29,563
Come on, stop it. What's so funny?

881
00:53:29,647 --> 00:53:31,106
Oh, sorry.

882
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,567
I've never seen clothes rip like that.

883
00:53:34,652 --> 00:53:37,947
I told you, the issue is
with the clothes, not me.

884
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:40,658
How is this a small?
These are like kids' clothes.

885
00:53:40,741 --> 00:53:43,244
The sizing of women's clothing is
problematic nowadays.

886
00:53:46,163 --> 00:53:47,873
Great, now my heels are acting up?

887
00:54:08,686 --> 00:54:09,812
Be careful.

888
00:54:23,617 --> 00:54:25,160
Thank you.

889
00:54:41,635 --> 00:54:44,513
I've never seen
the fireworks at Han River before.

890
00:55:05,242 --> 00:55:08,287
I didn't realize when I watched it on TV,

891
00:55:08,912 --> 00:55:10,539
but it's really pretty.

892
00:55:11,248 --> 00:55:12,541
Isn't it?

893
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:13,792
Yes.

894
00:55:17,212 --> 00:55:18,297
Very pretty.

895
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:40,361
Don't you have to tell your grandfather
about our date tonight?

896
00:55:40,444 --> 00:55:43,656
Don't worry. Manager Oh probably
already told him all about it.

897
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:47,701
What do we do about this?

898
00:55:47,785 --> 00:55:49,495
You can't even get a refund
because it's ripped.

899
00:55:49,578 --> 00:55:51,747
It's a fake anniversary,
but it's still a gift.

900
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:53,207
Of course, I won't ask you to pay for it.

901
00:55:59,129 --> 00:56:01,840
I had fun
on our fake anniversary date tonight.

902
00:56:01,924 --> 00:56:03,342
I had fun too

903
00:56:03,425 --> 00:56:04,927
on our anniversary date.

904
00:56:08,347 --> 00:56:09,723
I better head inside.

905
00:56:55,144 --> 00:56:57,855
I got to wear such expensive clothes.

906
00:57:09,241 --> 00:57:11,201
Hey, Ha-ri! Hey, Shin Ha-ri!

907
00:57:12,578 --> 00:57:14,747
Have you no conscience at all?

908
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,915
You were out all day
on this precious Saturday.

909
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:19,293
Can you switch with me now?

910
00:57:19,376 --> 00:57:20,836
Okay, I'll be right out.

911
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:23,088
Get out.

912
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:50,115
<i>The person you have called is unavailable.
Please leave your message…</i>

913
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:52,201
Hey, Ha-ri.

914
00:57:52,868 --> 00:57:54,661
Hey, Min-woo. What's up?

915
00:57:54,745 --> 00:57:56,705
I brought some abalones for your mom.

916
00:57:56,789 --> 00:57:59,750
-Really? Go ahead inside.
-Okay, see you inside.

917
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:00,709
Okay.

918
00:58:01,335 --> 00:58:03,170
Why is Ms. Shin…

Hello, Mr. Kang?

Shin Ha-ri, Shin Geum-hui,

925
00:59:28,922 --> 00:59:31,425
Schedule a meeting at two
with Food Product Development Team One.

926
00:59:31,508 --> 00:59:33,468
You want me to go to
the Founding Anniversary Ceremony…
