BUSINESS PROPOSAL

2
00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:06,957
EPISODE 8

3
00:00:20,638 --> 00:00:21,972
Can I consider this

4
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:26,310
as a positive response to
me asking you out?

5
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,313
No!

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,941
No, that's not it, sir.

7
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:33,233
-What?
-What?

8
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:34,318
This is…

9
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:36,904
a mistake. It was a mistake.

10
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:38,072
What?

11
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:40,032
A mistake?

12
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:41,116
No, I mean…

13
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:46,872
I think I went crazy for a bit there.
Why did I…

14
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,792
Can we pretend that never happened?

15
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:50,709
Let's…

16
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,252
See you tomorrow.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,637
Ha-ri, what did you just do?

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,554
Wait!

19
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:07,935
You're just leaving like this?

20
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,270
-I--
-Ha-ri.

21
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,774
We've all been looking for you.

22
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:15,109
Oh, really?

23
00:01:16,652 --> 00:01:17,486
Let's go, then.

24
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,066
She kisses me first, then what? A mistake?

25
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,360
She's a pro, isn't she?

26
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:03,653
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
<i>A BUSINESS PROPOSAL</i>

27
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:11,248
I wish I had leave days left to use.

28
00:02:14,877 --> 00:02:16,837
How am I supposed to see him again?

29
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,279
Hello.

30
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,072
What's this?

31
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:46,492
-Gosh.
-What are you all looking at?

32
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,287
There's our best worker.

33
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,371
What?

34
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:59,296
YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE CUTTING BOARD!

35
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,091
SUDDENLY IT'S LIKE THE MOVIE PSYCHO?

36
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:03,175
THANKFULLY, IT WASN'T SERIOUS

37
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:06,136
<i>No, this isn't blood. I accidentally
pressed on the sauce bottle.</i>

38
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,304
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

39
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,182
<i>Our company never puts artificial
coloring in our sauces.</i>

40
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:12,893
<i>So it doesn't stain and comes right out.</i>

41
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:14,144
<i>You can't even tell.</i>

42
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:15,687
<i>I think it's good.</i>

43
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:18,982
What is this? This is so embarrassing.

44
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,777
Why? They love you
in the comments, too. Look.

45
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,362
<i>She's worth a hundred employees.</i>

46
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:26,156
<i>If her boss is really watching,
he should give her a bonus.</i>

47
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:30,369
Ms. Shin. If you actually get a bonus,
don't just keep it for yourself, okay?

48
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:35,958
Mr. Gye, could you please stop eating

49
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,251
and get back to work?

50
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:39,169
You're chewing so loudly!

51
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:43,257
Don't be like that. I was just hungry.

52
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,343
Right. As I told you yesterday,

53
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,513
each of you should come up
with five product ideas

54
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,473
for the dumplings that will be exported.

55
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:55,144
And don't just come up with a list
for the sake of it, understand?

56
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:57,563
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay, then!

57
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:05,195
Thank you.

58
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:18,333
<i>The person you have called can not come…</i>

59
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:19,501
Really now?

60
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:22,296
She's going to dodge my calls?

61
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:32,389
Sir, it's ready.

62
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:39,855
I'll take the picture now.

63
00:04:39,938 --> 00:04:40,814
Wait.

64
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,193
Just a moment, please.

65
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:51,074
Okay, I'll take the picture now.

66
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,953
DONATION FOR THE TREATMENT
OF RARE CANCERS

67
00:04:57,956 --> 00:05:00,292
I should thank you
for letting me be a part of this.

68
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,376
Is that so?

69
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:04,046
I'll see you another time, then.

70
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:07,925
President Kang.

71
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:12,638
Director Jin Chae-rim
from Marine Art Museum.

72
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:16,266
Look at you.

73
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,393
Long time, no see.

74
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:22,481
It's been a while, Director Jin.

75
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:25,067
I last saw you when you opened
your museum three years ago.

76
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:28,695
Maybe it's because
of your time in New York,

77
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,656
but you've become even more handsome.

78
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,117
Is that so?

79
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,369
Figures.

80
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:38,080
Software or hardware,

81
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:40,290
you're perfect inside and out.

82
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,626
Of course, you want someone
better than Young-seo.

83
00:05:44,962 --> 00:05:45,796
It's all right.

84
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,506
Young-seo may be my niece,

85
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:51,468
but objectively speaking,
you're too good for Young-seo.

86
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:53,720
Sir.

87
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:59,184
I'm sorry, but I have somewhere to be.

88
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:01,311
Sure. I'll see you next time.

89
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:08,485
DONATION FOR THE TREATMENT
OF RARE CANCERS

90
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,404
What a shame.

91
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:13,198
He's always so handsome.

92
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,458
Yes, my daughter?

93
00:06:25,544 --> 00:06:28,797
I want to quit my job.
Can you get me a position at the museum?

94
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:34,344
If you quit, then Young-seo
will snatch up your position right away.

95
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:36,305
Is it okay with you?

96
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:37,222
No!

97
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:42,102
I don't want that, but…

98
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,313
Really?

99
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,899
You'll ask Grandpa
to make me the managing director?

100
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,319
Okay! Bye, Mom!

101
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,615
I'm still out for a meeting,
but how about dinner tonight?

102
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,370
Sure. I'll see you at home later.

103
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,248
Yes.

104
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:14,009
You're done for the day.
Would you like to go home?

105
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:16,386
No, I have plans, so I'll get going.

106
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,637
Where are you going?

107
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:19,556
-I can--
-Let me have my privacy.

108
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:22,142
I'll drive myself there. You can go home.

109
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,895
-What?
-It's time for you to clock out.

110
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:28,065
I'm doing something nice for you.
Enjoy your evening.

111
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:31,318
Enjoy your dinner.

112
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,909
You're all grown up now, Sung-hoon.

113
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:52,547
Don't we need to talk?

114
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,634
Talk?

115
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,431
The thing that happened yesterday?
Weren't we already done talking about it?

116
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:02,516
Done?

117
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:03,642
Says who?

118
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:07,062
I told you to just pretend
that it never happened.

119
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:09,231
So you're just going to say

120
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:12,192
that it was a simple mistake
after kissing me first?

121
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:13,527
You've been dodging my calls too!

122
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,820
I mean, the kiss…

123
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,449
That was because

124
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:23,370
we were standing so close together.

125
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:27,457
And we just bumped into each other,
like a fender-bender.

126
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,792
A fender-bender?

127
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,421
Are my lips some kind of a column
for you to crash into?

128
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:35,882
Well, that's not what I was trying to say.

129
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,969
So, what happened yesterday was a mistake

130
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,762
you made simply out of lust.

131
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:43,390
And you have no feelings for me?

132
00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:45,183
What do you mean, lust?

133
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:48,728
I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose.

134
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:50,897
A mistake or not,

135
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:52,774
you're the one who started it.

136
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:54,651
So you should make up for it, right?

137
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:58,989
Right, that…

138
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:01,324
I'll do what I can

139
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,537
to take responsibility and pay you back.

140
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:08,665
Very well.

141
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:13,211
Buy me dinner to pay me back
for kissing me.

142
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:15,839
What?

143
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,800
How can you ask a commoner
to buy you something this expensive?

144
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:21,011
You said that you would make up for it.

145
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,054
To be honest, that kiss…

146
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:29,394
I didn't do that by myself.
You kissed me back.

147
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:31,188
Like a total player.

148
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,608
All skilled and whatnot…

149
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,402
So you're not the only one at fault?

150
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:38,820
Correct.

151
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:42,574
Then let me take care of you
for the rest of your life,

152
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:43,700
as a man to a woman.

153
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,955
That's not what we're talking about.

154
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,167
I told you that I have feelings for you.

155
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,920
How could I stay still
when the woman I liked

156
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:57,714
started kissing me so aggressively?

157
00:09:58,632 --> 00:09:59,549
I mean…

158
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:01,885
That's…

159
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,763
Then pay me back in another way.

160
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:06,723
What other way?

161
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,809
I prefer to pay people back with
exactly what I received from them.

162
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:11,311
An eye for an eye

163
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:12,479
and a kiss for a kiss.

164
00:10:13,897 --> 00:10:15,732
Fine. I'll pay for the food.

165
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:19,861
But you can eat by yourself.
I'll just skip this meal.

166
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,865
Here is your amuse-bouche.

167
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:43,927
Chef Lee, could you smile more naturally?

168
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:45,929
Sure.

169
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,180
He must be nervous.

170
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,308
-Should we take a quick break, then?
-Sure.

171
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:53,687
What are you doing?

172
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,063
You didn't even ask me.

173
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:56,564
Other people would love it.

174
00:10:56,648 --> 00:10:58,149
Why are you complaining?

175
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:02,487
Why are you like this to me lately?

176
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,405
What do you mean?

177
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:05,448
You've been like that ever since Sokcho

178
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:06,449
as if you're angry.

179
00:11:09,077 --> 00:11:10,829
I'm just stressed out because of work.

180
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,416
Chef Lee.

181
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:17,919
You looked great on video
and you look great in these pictures, too.

182
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:19,754
You watched those?

183
00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:21,131
-Thank you.
-Sure.

184
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:23,800
By the way, when that researcher
from go food

185
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,386
talked about food coloring
after spilling that sauce,

186
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:27,679
that was scripted, right?

187
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:31,308
-That was probably--
-No. That was totally unscripted.

188
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:34,686
Ha-ri isn't quick enough
to act out something like that.

189
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,229
She's really innocent, you know.

190
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,358
<i>…on your table.</i>

191
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:43,111
<i>Have a delicious day with go food!</i>

192
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:46,865
THEY LOOK GOOD TOGETHER
THEY HAVE TO BE DATING

193
00:11:46,948 --> 00:11:48,658
IF THEY AREN'T, THEY SHOULD!

194
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:55,457
What is it?
Is the food not to your liking?

195
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:58,126
No, that's not it.

196
00:11:58,877 --> 00:12:03,840
<i>I just can't enjoy the food when I think
about my credit card bill next month.</i>

197
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,099
Chef, what's all this?

198
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,268
We'd like you
to taste-test our newest menu.

199
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:17,354
You're asking your customers
to do your work?

200
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:20,648
Your palate is much more refined
than mine, sir.

201
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,319
You're a regular at our restaurant.
Please do this for me.

202
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:25,653
I understand.

203
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:27,072
Thank you, President Kang.

204
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:11,199
Why aren't you eating?

205
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:17,455
I need to go to the bathroom.

206
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:25,171
Ha-ri!

207
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:26,714
Have you always been like this?

208
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:29,426
What are you doing? Snap out of it,
please! Why…

209
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,636
Why…

210
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:34,472
<i>Until that day when the waters</i>

211
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:38,560
<i>Of the East Sea run dry
And Mount Baekdusan is worn away</i>

212
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:50,089
You play the piano too?

213
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:51,674
Have you forgotten already?

214
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,676
I told you, I'm good at everything.

215
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,764
Do you play the piano for every woman
that you meet?

216
00:14:57,847 --> 00:15:01,684
I don't have to answer that
since we're not in a relationship.

217
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:04,979
If you want to hear the answer,
go out with me.

218
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:07,065
I'll grab the check.

219
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:08,900
Could you bring us the check, please?

220
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,735
Our coats and wallets too.

221
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:14,322
Here you are.

222
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:16,783
Would it be possible
to pay in six installments?

223
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:17,867
He already paid.

224
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:18,952
He did?

225
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:22,831
Have a good night.

226
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:23,915
Wait.

227
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:27,836
Why did you do that?

228
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,420
I needed to pay.

229
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:31,881
I thought about it,

230
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,801
and I didn't want you
to pay back for the kiss with this.

231
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:38,429
I want something bigger,
so brace yourself.

232
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:40,640
But…

233
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:44,143
What more expensive meal do you want then?

234
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:45,144
Or…

235
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:48,982
pay me back with something else.

236
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:51,526
Forget it.

237
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:54,237
You already paid,
so it can't be helped, but…

238
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:00,034
Fine. I'll buy you
a more expensive meal next time.

239
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:01,619
I'll be looking forward to it.

240
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:03,621
What should we eat next time?

241
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:05,206
Steak?

242
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:06,791
<i>Omakase</i>?

243
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:09,919
Careful.

244
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,921
No peeking.

245
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,047
Okay.

246
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:14,674
Turn left here.

247
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,219
Ta-da!

248
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:21,014
Surprise!

249
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,684
Did you do this all by yourself?

250
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:28,688
There may be some things I don't do,
but there's nothing I can't do.

251
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:31,357
I looked up some recipes online.
It was easy.

252
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:33,943
But you must have been tired
after work. How did you…

253
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,111
It's okay.

254
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,947
Come on. Have a seat and try the food.

255
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:47,332
Let's dig in, then.

256
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:09,062
How is it?

257
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:12,190
It's delicious.

258
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:15,109
Come on. You don't sound like
you mean that.

259
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:16,653
Come on, be honest.

260
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:22,617
It's good.

261
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:29,290
Things can only improve
if a customer gives good feedback.

262
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,168
Honestly, how is it?

263
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,761
If I'm being honest,
all the food is a bit salty.

264
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:45,932
Other than that, it's okay?

265
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:49,686
Well, as for these clams,
I'm tasting some sand.

266
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,605
As for the pork belly,
it smells a bit fishy.

267
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:54,732
It probably wasn't defrosted properly.

268
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:56,609
The vegetables are overcooked.

269
00:17:56,693 --> 00:17:58,569
And the rice is a bit undercooked.

270
00:17:59,153 --> 00:18:00,780
As for the rest, I need to try…

271
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:04,575
I think they'll be delicious.

272
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:06,452
What's there left to taste?

273
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:08,246
The water?

274
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,248
The water must taste delicious.

275
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:11,666
I'm sorry. I…

276
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:16,421
I'm used to giving honest feedback,
due to the nature of my job.

277
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,174
I'm going to the bathroom.

278
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,308
He really wasn't holding back, was he?

279
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,729
Is he my boyfriend
or a Michelin guide judge?

280
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:38,651
CLAMS, PORK BELLY, VEGETABLES, RICE

281
00:18:38,735 --> 00:18:39,610
<i>What?</i>

282
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:41,529
You're dating Secretary Cha?

283
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,615
When did you two start dating?

284
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:47,827
More importantly,
you are persistent after all, Young-seo.

285
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,830
Congratulations
on putting an end to your crush.

286
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:54,208
I don't know if I should be congratulated.

287
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:58,254
Why? You finally got your boyfriend.
What else is there to congratulate?

288
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,673
-He didn't like it.
-What?

289
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:03,593
I cooked someone dinner
for the first time in my life.

290
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:04,886
Right, yes.

291
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:06,554
But he said it was salty.

292
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:10,808
If your girlfriend cooks for you,
shouldn't you clear all the plates

293
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:12,477
even if it tastes like saltwater?

294
00:19:13,478 --> 00:19:14,896
No, you might die then.

295
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,398
That President Kang is annoying too.

296
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:19,150
What about President Kang?

297
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:21,861
I was watching a movie
with Sung-hoon yesterday.

298
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:24,906
We were having a good time
until President Kang called him.

299
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:27,366
He was out for over 30 minutes
taking that call.

300
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,827
Even a president shouldn't do that!

301
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:32,121
It's not like he did that on purpose.

302
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,581
He didn't know you two were on a date.

303
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:34,707
What is this?

304
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,959
This is suspicious.

305
00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:38,961
Are you two a thing now?

306
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,630
It's not like that.

307
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,716
No. You're really suspicious right now.

308
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,343
You ate at work, right?

309
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:47,345
You ate with Kang Tae-moo, didn't you?

310
00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:49,263
You were on a date with him. Right?

311
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:51,682
No. It wasn't a date. We just ate…

312
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:55,353
See? I was right.

313
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:57,522
If you ate together, that's a date.

314
00:19:58,189 --> 00:20:00,274
No, it wasn't like that. I…

315
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,113
There was a little situation,
so I ate with him to apologize.

316
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:07,990
Why? Is he nagging at you again
because of work?

317
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:08,908
What?

318
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:11,619
Kang Tae-moo is being so mean.

319
00:20:11,702 --> 00:20:14,080
If he likes you,
he should be nicer to you.

320
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,082
Is he a pervert?

321
00:20:16,707 --> 00:20:17,708
What?

322
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:20,253
I think he is a pervert. Watch out.

323
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:22,171
No…

324
00:20:22,964 --> 00:20:23,965
What?

325
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:25,758
What?

326
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:27,051
They broke up already?

327
00:20:27,135 --> 00:20:30,221
You were so excited thinking
about Tae-moo getting married this year.

328
00:20:30,304 --> 00:20:31,931
Whatever.

329
00:20:32,014 --> 00:20:33,766
Are you sure they didn't break up

330
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,353
because you were acting
like a nosy grandfather?

331
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,314
Do you think I'm some old-fashioned,
condescending person?

332
00:20:40,398 --> 00:20:43,860
I treated Ms. Shin Geum-hui really well.

333
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,821
It's obvious.
You know his personality, right?

334
00:20:46,904 --> 00:20:49,198
Hey, if you want Tae-moo to get married,

335
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,617
just don't do anything.

336
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:52,743
-Yes.
-Okay?

337
00:20:52,827 --> 00:20:53,995
What?

338
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:56,914
You bastards, you don't know anything.

339
00:20:56,998 --> 00:20:58,124
-See, my--
-Oh my.

340
00:20:58,207 --> 00:20:59,083
Chairman Kang!

341
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:01,043
Have you been well?

342
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:03,337
Long time, no see.

343
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:06,007
Hello.

344
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:07,967
Director Jin.

345
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:10,595
How have you been?

346
00:21:23,232 --> 00:21:24,275
Chicken yesterday.

347
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:25,985
Chicken today.

348
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:27,028
Chicken tomorrow!

349
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:29,739
It's all chicken!

350
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:31,324
Honey!

351
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:34,660
I'm coming!

352
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:41,167
-Can you put it up here?
-Sure.

353
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:45,254
Why did you come down already?
I thought you worked all night yesterday.

354
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:49,050
You said we have a big group
coming in today. I should help.

355
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,637
It's fine. We can do it.

356
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,641
What's wrong, Dad? Is it your stomach?

357
00:21:58,517 --> 00:21:59,560
I knew this would happen

358
00:21:59,644 --> 00:22:02,605
when I saw you stuffing your face
with beef tartare yesterday.

359
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,732
Do you need to go to the hospital?

360
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:07,401
It's fine.

361
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:12,239
I'll be okay once I go to the bathroom
a couple of times.

362
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:14,241
Go to the bathroom then.

363
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:22,249
He shouldn't have eaten so much.

364
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,877
He overate just because
he was in a good mood.

365
00:22:27,254 --> 00:22:28,339
HIKING ROUTE

366
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,300
We're at the wrong place, right?

367
00:22:32,593 --> 00:22:33,761
We're at the right place.

368
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:43,229
I thought you wanted to
take a walk somewhere nice,

369
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:44,522
but this is a mountain.

370
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:47,858
I thought you really needed exercise,
so here we are.

371
00:22:47,942 --> 00:22:50,528
Come on, I'm tired already.

372
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:51,696
You're always tired

373
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:54,824
because you're always sitting at your desk
or lying on the couch.

374
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:55,950
Exercise with me now.

375
00:22:56,617 --> 00:22:57,827
How about later?

376
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,203
I'm wearing the wrong shoes.

377
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:00,997
I prepared for that, too.

378
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:02,665
What?

379
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:04,834
Prepare what?

380
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:11,632
It's a perfect fit.

381
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:13,384
Let's go.

382
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:18,723
The weather's so nice.

383
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,854
He may be my boyfriend,
but he's a piece of work.

384
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:28,065
Why did he call me out of the blue
on a weekend?

385
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:29,692
How annoying.

386
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:41,203
Ms. Shin.

387
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:49,170
Why did you ask to see me here?

388
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:51,797
What do you think?
I wanted to get payback for that kiss.

389
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,760
I don't think there's a good place
to eat around here.

390
00:23:55,843 --> 00:23:57,011
Forget about eating.

391
00:23:57,094 --> 00:23:59,430
Spend the day with me today as payment.

392
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:01,098
What?

393
00:24:01,182 --> 00:24:04,602
You said I shouldn't make
a commoner pay for an expensive meal.

394
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,897
So I'll buy your time instead.

395
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,231
My…

396
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,401
Time?

397
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:55,361
Wait.

398
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:57,071
Let's take a break.

399
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:01,659
My legs hurt.

400
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:07,748
-Are you tired?
-Yes.

401
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,756
You were right. I'm really out of shape.

402
00:25:16,757 --> 00:25:17,842
How are you not tired?

403
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:19,969
Come here with me whenever you have time.

404
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,513
I climb this mountain often
because it's my favorite.

405
00:25:23,597 --> 00:25:24,473
Often?

406
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,481
Who did you climb
this mountain with so often?

407
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:34,150
An ex-girlfriend?

408
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,734
No, with President Kang.

409
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,822
You go hiking with your boss?

410
00:25:40,531 --> 00:25:43,659
You're not being forced into it
or anything, right?

411
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:44,618
What?

412
00:25:44,702 --> 00:25:47,913
When you think about it, President Kang
only thinks about himself.

413
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:51,083
I can tell by the way he treats you,
and Ha-ri, too.

414
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,376
What do you mean?

415
00:25:52,877 --> 00:25:56,463
He told Ha-ri to pay him back
for something again.

416
00:25:56,547 --> 00:25:58,507
Ha-ri's face looked so tired.

417
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:01,552
What a petty guy.

418
00:26:01,635 --> 00:26:03,679
That's not the type of person he is.

419
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,307
You shouldn't bad-mouth others
like that, Young-seo.

420
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:09,268
What do you mean?

421
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:11,812
It's true that Mr. Kang
was being mean to Ha-ri.

422
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:13,772
-What I'm saying is--
-I mean,

423
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:16,859
when he found out Ha-ri was Geum-hui,
he should have been a man

424
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:20,154
and asked her, "Explain what happened."
Like a normal person.

425
00:26:20,237 --> 00:26:21,780
But he didn't ask her anything.

426
00:26:21,864 --> 00:26:24,909
He just made her really anxious
and was a jerk to her at work.

427
00:26:24,992 --> 00:26:26,577
Wasn't that a power trip?

428
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,245
Power trip?

429
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:31,707
He had the right to be angry
since he had been fooled.

430
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,794
Besides, you shouldn't be talking
like that. You're at fault too.

431
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:38,005
What?

432
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:41,592
If you hadn't sent Ms. Shin in your place,
something like this wouldn't have--

433
00:26:42,843 --> 00:26:44,637
This is just ridiculous.

434
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:46,096
What do you mean?

435
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,891
If you're my boyfriend,

436
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:52,061
then you should be thankful
that I didn't go on that blind date.

437
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:54,605
Do you think it makes sense
for you to be scolding me

438
00:26:54,688 --> 00:26:56,232
for not going on a blind date?

439
00:26:56,732 --> 00:26:58,525
Young-seo, just calm down.

440
00:26:58,609 --> 00:26:59,902
Let's be more logical--

441
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,153
How can I?

442
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,489
What's a boyfriend for?

443
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:07,451
Isn't a boyfriend supposed to be
on your side no matter what?

444
00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:09,703
I cooked for you,
but you said it was too salty.

445
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:12,373
You couldn't focus on the movie
because of work.

446
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:13,707
And even now, look!

447
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:16,085
You're taking
Kang Tae-moo's side and not mine.

448
00:27:18,045 --> 00:27:18,879
I'm sorry.

449
00:27:18,963 --> 00:27:20,506
I didn't mean it like that.

450
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,425
Don't be mad. Let's just
climb all the way up.

451
00:27:24,218 --> 00:27:25,636
Climb all the way up?

452
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,346
No!

453
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:32,226
Why don't you climb this damn mountain
with Kang Tae-moo?

454
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:35,145
Come on, Young-seo!

455
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:36,063
Young-seo!

456
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:48,951
Here.

457
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:52,037
I'm hungry. Do you want to go eat?

458
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:52,955
I'll buy.

459
00:27:53,831 --> 00:27:54,790
It's fine.

460
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,751
Spend just your time on me.
I'll spend the money.

461
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,175
No, I can't do that. I'm here
to pay you back. What do you want to eat?

462
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,307
Well, there is something
that I want to eat.

463
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:18,230
Will this really be enough?

464
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,524
What?

465
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,986
Seeing as you wanted to come

466
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,572
all the way to this deserted place
to get this,

467
00:28:26,655 --> 00:28:29,158
this must be some insanely good corn dog.

468
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:30,826
Right?

469
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,294
It's just a normal corn dog.

470
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,881
You should have gotten
something more filling then.

471
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:48,510
Did someone tell you you had to get
a corn dog if you go to an amusement park?

472
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,846
You do seem like someone
who's never been here.

473
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,017
I ate this

474
00:28:55,726 --> 00:28:57,478
with my parents when I was seven.

475
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:01,106
This hot dog tasted so good back then.

476
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,903
Whenever I think of it,
I come to eat it by myself sometimes.

477
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:15,162
You must have been really happy back then.

478
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,209
You know, when you eat food
that you had in the past,

479
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:23,045
you recall all of the happy memories
from back then,

480
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,297
and it tastes even better.

481
00:29:26,382 --> 00:29:27,383
For me,

482
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:29,218
<i>gimbap</i> is like that.

483
00:29:29,843 --> 00:29:31,470
Maybe it's because of field trips.

484
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:34,098
That hamburger from back then
was like that, too. Right.

485
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:38,352
You're different, Ms. Shin.

486
00:29:39,937 --> 00:29:41,730
When I bring up my parents,

487
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,942
most people look like
they don't know what to say

488
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:46,985
and say that they're sorry.

489
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:51,198
So I never got to talk about this

490
00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:54,576
despite it being
one of the fondest memories I have.

491
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,577
Even to my grandpa.

492
00:29:57,955 --> 00:29:59,498
But, sometimes…

493
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,001
I want to talk to someone

494
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:05,379
about my parents.

495
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:09,758
Thank you

496
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:12,678
for letting me talk about it like this.

497
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:23,230
Yes, why?

498
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:25,691
What?

499
00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:30,028
If he likes Kang Tae-moo so much,
why doesn't he just date him instead?

500
00:30:30,112 --> 00:30:31,405
Why is he dating me then?

501
00:30:31,488 --> 00:30:33,031
Unbelievable.

502
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,205
What is this place?

503
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:43,542
I don't think I took this path.

504
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,421
Come on.

505
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:49,757
Young-seo!

506
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,594
I knew we went faster
when we were climbing up.

507
00:30:54,261 --> 00:30:56,638
How could you leave like that
when you don't know the way?

508
00:30:57,306 --> 00:30:58,182
Where are we?

509
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:00,517
I don't know.

510
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:02,895
We should have gone left back there.

511
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,938
But you went right.

512
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:07,733
Are you blaming me again?

513
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,945
You sure are good at making me mad.
You really have a talent for it!

514
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:15,574
Stop following me if you're just
going to keep making me mad.

515
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,952
I'll be fine walking by myself.

516
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:20,537
Young-seo.

517
00:31:21,205 --> 00:31:22,372
Young-seo!

518
00:31:23,207 --> 00:31:24,500
Are you all right?

519
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,585
-Let me see. Let me see!
-Don't touch it.

520
00:31:27,836 --> 00:31:29,213
Does it hurt a lot?

521
00:31:35,135 --> 00:31:36,011
Get on my back.

522
00:31:37,387 --> 00:31:39,556
You're going to climb down
with me on your back?

523
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:42,518
That's crazy. No way. It's too dangerous.

524
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:45,437
I don't say what I don't mean.
I'll make it work, so get on.

525
00:31:48,357 --> 00:31:49,525
I'm heavy though.

526
00:31:57,032 --> 00:31:58,200
Hold on just a bit more.

527
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,266
How's your ankle? Is it feeling better?

528
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,894
Why aren't you saying anything?

529
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:27,563
Are you still mad at me?

530
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:33,944
I'll try my best to make sure
to never upset you like that again.

531
00:32:34,027 --> 00:32:35,404
Just forgive me this once--

532
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:37,906
Do you know

533
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:40,117
how sexy you look right now?

534
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:45,414
-What?
-I stopped being angry a while ago.

535
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:48,792
I was complaining the entire time,

536
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:52,754
but you didn't say a word
carrying me down all this way.

537
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,341
I guess you're a tough guy.

538
00:32:58,427 --> 00:33:00,304
I think I just fell for you again.

539
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,266
Young-seo.

540
00:33:05,976 --> 00:33:08,729
Okay, we need to go home quickly

541
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:11,982
and spend a steamy night together.

542
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:27,289
-Let's go to the hospital first.
-No, let's go home.

543
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,875
Let's go to the hospital first, and then…

544
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,126
And then?

545
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,044
Come on, get on.

546
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:33,879
Go to the hospital, and then?

547
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:37,633
Then let's go home, yes?

548
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,176
Let's go to the hospital first.

549
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:43,555
Young-seo, you lied about
being hurt, right?

550
00:33:45,265 --> 00:33:47,476
I'm here to see patient Han Mi-mo.

551
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,894
-One moment.
-Okay.

552
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:53,023
Mom!

553
00:33:53,941 --> 00:33:55,067
Ha-ri.

554
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,736
Are you okay? Are you badly hurt?
Let me see.

555
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:01,615
No, it's just a light burn.
They said I don't need to worry about it.

556
00:34:02,282 --> 00:34:03,825
But the problem is…

557
00:34:10,374 --> 00:34:11,708
Dad!

558
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:13,377
What happened?

559
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,504
Ha-min said you were the one who got hurt.

560
00:34:18,715 --> 00:34:20,467
Apparently, it was acute appendicitis.

561
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,511
He just came out of emergency surgery.

562
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,596
Then why are you staying here?

563
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,264
They said there was no empty bed,

564
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:28,350
so I asked them to tell us
if one freed up.

565
00:34:31,061 --> 00:34:32,646
-Dad.
-Honey.

566
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:34,106
Honey.

567
00:34:34,189 --> 00:34:35,357
Mi-mo.

568
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:37,693
Is your arm okay?

569
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:39,945
You're worried about that right now?

570
00:34:40,028 --> 00:34:42,197
You didn't know
that your appendix was ruptured?

571
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,200
Why did you have to act so tough
and carry me to the hospital?

572
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,535
What if you hurt your back?

573
00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:50,706
I was worried that your pearly skin

574
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,083
would become scarred.

575
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:55,252
Oh, my.

576
00:34:56,044 --> 00:34:57,212
-Mr. Shin Joong-hae.
-Yes.

577
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,006
Your room is ready. You can move now.

578
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:00,549
There's an open spot in a room?

579
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,592
No. We were told to
move him to a VIP room.

580
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:05,303
-A VIP room?
-Who said that?

581
00:35:07,723 --> 00:35:08,849
There he comes.

582
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:13,353
Hello.

583
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:14,813
Who…

584
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:20,402
-I'm the pre--
-He's in the same team as me at work.

585
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,821
He's my supervisor. Yes.

586
00:35:24,197 --> 00:35:26,408
A supervisor from work?

587
00:35:27,617 --> 00:35:29,828
But Ms. Yeo is a woman.

588
00:35:32,372 --> 00:35:33,749
-You must be Mr. Gye!
-What?

589
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:37,002
Right! Yes. He's Mr. Gye Bin.

590
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:39,880
Mr. Gye, these are my parents.
Please introduce yourself.

591
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:42,841
Mr. Gye.

592
00:35:49,431 --> 00:35:51,475
Yes, hello. I'm Gye Bin.

593
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,360
It's okay.

594
00:36:03,653 --> 00:36:07,491
Gosh, this bed is even better
than a hotel bed.

595
00:36:07,574 --> 00:36:10,744
I wish that I could rest
somewhere like this for a couple of days.

596
00:36:11,411 --> 00:36:12,245
Mom.

597
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:14,456
What? Did I say something wrong?

598
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:17,459
See, it's a lot bigger
than our master bedroom.

599
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,961
Mr. Gye, you shouldn't have.

600
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:22,130
We owe you for doing this.

601
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:25,592
You didn't have to do all this for us.

602
00:36:25,675 --> 00:36:28,470
It's nothing. I happen to know
someone at this hospital.

603
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,888
Don't feel uncomfortable.

604
00:36:30,764 --> 00:36:32,682
But I heard Mr. Gye

605
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:35,519
was in his mid-40s.

606
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:37,854
You look really young for your age!

607
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:42,234
Yes, I hear that often.

608
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:43,902
Mom, come on--

609
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:45,070
Why?

610
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:49,574
Mr. Gye, you must be really tired.
Why don't you go on home?

611
00:36:50,158 --> 00:36:51,660
-That's a good idea.
-Right? Yes.

612
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:54,079
Hey! Where are your manners?

613
00:36:54,162 --> 00:36:55,705
He still did us a huge favor.

614
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:58,375
Please sit. Have something to drink. Sit.

615
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,461
Come on.

616
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:03,046
Here, have some honey water.

617
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,714
-Oh, honey water.
-Yes.

618
00:37:04,798 --> 00:37:06,842
You must be tired working on the weekend

619
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,552
when you should be

620
00:37:09,386 --> 00:37:12,013
getting some rest.

621
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,098
Work?

622
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:15,934
Ha-ri said that she was heading out

623
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:17,978
to go to work today.

624
00:37:20,564 --> 00:37:25,026
Mr. Gye, did you forget already?
We worked overtime today.

625
00:37:29,698 --> 00:37:30,532
Right.

626
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:31,533
-Yes.
-We worked overtime.

627
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,910
-Yes, overtime.
-We're very busy at work.

628
00:37:34,578 --> 00:37:36,288
-Yes.
-I heard that your new president

629
00:37:36,371 --> 00:37:37,539
was handed the position.

630
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:41,126
You have no idea how much
Ha-ri ran her mouth off,

631
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:44,713
saying her workload increased so much
after the president changed.

632
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,256
-Mom!
-That bastard.

633
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:48,175
When did I say that?

634
00:37:48,258 --> 00:37:49,843
The day before yesterday, you--

635
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:52,304
<i>Shin Ha-ri, you…</i>

636
00:37:52,888 --> 00:37:54,431
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

637
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:00,103
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

638
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:02,272
It's fine. It's nothing.

639
00:38:02,355 --> 00:38:04,191
It isn't nothing. You're bleeding.

640
00:38:04,774 --> 00:38:06,985
Go put on some ointment
while I clean up here.

641
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:08,361
It's in Ha-ri's room.

642
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:44,064
An employment contract?

643
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:46,608
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

644
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:50,153
So they weren't actually…

645
00:38:51,988 --> 00:38:53,365
in a relationship?

646
00:38:56,076 --> 00:38:58,078
He knows about us.
There's no need to be shy.

647
00:38:59,454 --> 00:39:00,288
Right?

648
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:06,670
Thank you for today.

649
00:39:07,337 --> 00:39:09,756
And I'm sorry for what happened
at the hospital.

650
00:39:10,423 --> 00:39:11,925
I didn't mean for that to happen.

651
00:39:12,008 --> 00:39:12,884
Don't be sorry.

652
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,303
A mean boss deserves that much.

653
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:16,304
No, I--

654
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:18,723
Pay me back for the kiss
like you were supposed to.

655
00:39:18,807 --> 00:39:19,933
What do you mean--

656
00:39:20,016 --> 00:39:22,978
It's unfair. I didn't know
that you bad-mouthed me.

657
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,980
I even gave you a discount!

658
00:39:25,647 --> 00:39:26,982
How is that fair?

659
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,650
I'm a mean boss, remember?

660
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:32,153
If you don't have the money,

661
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:34,614
pay it back with a kiss.

662
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:37,909
How's that?

663
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,789
Hey, Min-woo!

664
00:39:44,124 --> 00:39:45,333
What do you think you're doing?

665
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:46,918
I could ask you the same thing.

666
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:48,878
Stop hanging around Ha-ri

667
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,256
and get lost.

668
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:52,215
What?

669
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:54,301
I should be saying that.

670
00:39:54,384 --> 00:39:55,552
Stop it, Mr. Kang!

671
00:39:56,678 --> 00:39:58,138
What are you doing?

672
00:40:01,891 --> 00:40:03,977
Go home. I'll see you at work tomorrow.

673
00:40:18,158 --> 00:40:20,618
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

674
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:24,164
How did you get this?

675
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:27,125
Were you forced into a contract
relationship because of money?

676
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:29,044
Did he threaten you?

677
00:40:31,755 --> 00:40:32,630
That bastard.

678
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:35,800
Why didn't you tell me?

679
00:40:35,884 --> 00:40:37,052
If you had told me--

680
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,178
Why should I

681
00:40:39,054 --> 00:40:41,389
have told you about this?

682
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:46,019
-What?
-I don't think it's any of your business

683
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:50,815
whether I'm in a fake relationship
with him or not.

684
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:52,776
-Ha-ri.
-I stopped you two

685
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:55,195
because I was worried someone would see it

686
00:40:55,278 --> 00:40:58,073
and it might be released in the news.

687
00:40:59,032 --> 00:41:02,535
When you see President Kang again,
you need to give him a formal apology.

688
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:10,085
I know you're doing this because you're
worried about me as a friend. I know.

689
00:41:11,586 --> 00:41:12,587
But didn't I tell you?

690
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:14,547
I can take care of myself.

691
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:16,049
Are you saying that…

692
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,968
you actually like Kang Tae-moo?

693
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:21,846
He's just using you--

694
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,515
Don't talk about him like that.

695
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:28,019
He doesn't deserve it.

696
00:41:30,647 --> 00:41:32,649
You know perfectly well it won't work out

697
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:34,984
between you two.

698
00:41:42,575 --> 00:41:43,451
It's getting late.

699
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,328
I need to get going.

700
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,259
That wasn't what I was trying to do.

701
00:42:00,844 --> 00:42:02,011
Stop it, Mr. Kang!

702
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,472
What are you doing?

703
00:42:12,313 --> 00:42:14,607
MR. KANG, I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER

704
00:42:14,691 --> 00:42:19,904
I DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE MIN-WOO'S SIDE.
IT'S JUST THAT THERE WAS A POLICE CAR…

705
00:42:19,988 --> 00:42:22,073
You know perfectly well it won't work out

706
00:42:23,032 --> 00:42:24,492
between you two.

707
00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:00,612
HA-RI

708
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:02,363
<i>Thank you for today.</i>

709
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:05,325
<i>I'll pay you back for the hospital bill
as soon as I get paid.</i>

710
00:43:06,326 --> 00:43:09,454
SHIN HA-RI

711
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:25,404
Let's get going, quick.

712
00:43:25,488 --> 00:43:26,572
Let's go.

713
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,616
Isn't that heavy?

714
00:43:29,283 --> 00:43:30,618
-Hello.
-Take your shoes off.

715
00:43:31,285 --> 00:43:33,162
That's so annoying.

716
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:34,330
-Hello.
-Hello.

717
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:36,582
-Hello.
-Hello.

718
00:43:36,665 --> 00:43:37,958
THANK YOU FOR TODAY.

719
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:41,712
I'LL PAY YOU BACK THE HOSPITAL BILL
AS SOON AS I GET PAID.

720
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,592
Whatever. This is for the best.

721
00:43:46,675 --> 00:43:48,427
FOOD PRODUCT RESEARCH TEAM FIELD DAY

722
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:50,095
Yes, I'm in the parking lot.

723
00:43:50,638 --> 00:43:51,805
Sung-hoon.

724
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:58,562
What are you doing here?

725
00:43:58,646 --> 00:44:01,273
I was out on business,
and there was a good bagel place.

726
00:44:01,357 --> 00:44:02,650
Share it with your team.

727
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:04,193
You really didn't have to.

728
00:44:05,194 --> 00:44:06,529
But thank you so much.

729
00:44:06,612 --> 00:44:08,364
If you're thankful, then here.

730
00:44:09,615 --> 00:44:10,950
-Right here?
-Yes.

731
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,997
See you later.

732
00:44:17,081 --> 00:44:18,082
Safe driving.

733
00:44:18,165 --> 00:44:19,166
I'll text you.

734
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:38,143
Sir.

735
00:44:43,857 --> 00:44:46,068
I'm sorry for not
telling you earlier, sir.

736
00:44:47,027 --> 00:44:49,738
What on earth happened?

737
00:44:49,822 --> 00:44:52,199
We ran into each other once,

738
00:44:53,284 --> 00:44:54,743
and I fell for her then.

739
00:44:55,494 --> 00:44:56,829
Then why didn't you tell me?

740
00:44:57,955 --> 00:45:01,625
I didn't know where to start,
since you, Ms. Jin, and Ms. Shin

741
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:04,503
are all tangled up
in this situation together.

742
00:45:06,297 --> 00:45:07,798
I thought you and I were…

743
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,384
It's fine.

744
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:12,261
The more I talk, the pettier I sound.

745
00:45:16,932 --> 00:45:18,350
-Thank you.
-Sure thing, sir.

746
00:45:24,398 --> 00:45:28,152
The president of a company should be
more diligent than his employees.

747
00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:30,654
Why are you so late for work?

748
00:45:32,781 --> 00:45:34,116
What brings you here?

749
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:36,869
Gosh, this smells really good.

750
00:45:37,453 --> 00:45:41,457
If you had something so good,
you should have brought me some too.

751
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,417
But you kept it to yourself?

752
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,586
Don't beat around the bush
and just say it.

753
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:46,670
I'm telling you this

754
00:45:47,338 --> 00:45:48,714
as your grandfather

755
00:45:49,882 --> 00:45:52,092
and as the founder of this company.

756
00:45:53,302 --> 00:45:54,136
So…

757
00:45:55,137 --> 00:45:57,431
you better not say no to me.

758
00:45:58,599 --> 00:45:59,683
Go on a blind date…

759
00:46:01,685 --> 00:46:02,895
today.

760
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:10,652
VICTORY IS IN OUR GRASP!
DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT TEAM

761
00:46:12,196 --> 00:46:13,739
Why are you just standing there?

762
00:46:30,464 --> 00:46:32,049
Okay!

763
00:46:44,353 --> 00:46:45,354
Time out!

764
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:46,271
What happened?

765
00:46:47,189 --> 00:46:48,565
Ms. Shin, are you okay?

766
00:46:48,649 --> 00:46:50,275
-Yes.
-Ms. Shin, are you okay?

767
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:51,693
-Yes.
-What?

768
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:53,570
A stretcher, quick!

769
00:46:53,654 --> 00:46:55,531
Stop overreacting.

770
00:46:57,574 --> 00:46:59,326
Does it hurt a lot? Oh, my.

771
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,870
-Some pain relief spray will do.
-Really?

772
00:47:01,954 --> 00:47:04,456
-Well, go back to your spots.
-Yes, ma'am.

773
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,749
Okay. Try to stand up.

774
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,334
We have an important announcement.

775
00:47:07,418 --> 00:47:10,462
A special prize
will be given to the MVP this year.

776
00:47:10,546 --> 00:47:13,924
The MVP researcher who gets the best score
in today's sports competition

777
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:17,845
will get the special opportunity
to have dinner

778
00:47:17,928 --> 00:47:19,972
one-on-one with President Kang!

779
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:24,685
One-on-one?

780
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:29,481
Man, look at that.

781
00:47:45,414 --> 00:47:46,290
Are you really

782
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:49,084
going to go on that blind date?

783
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:52,588
<i>A blind date?</i>

784
00:47:52,671 --> 00:47:55,841
Seven o'clock.
The Japanese restaurant at Koryo Hotel.

785
00:47:56,425 --> 00:47:57,301
Your date

786
00:47:58,427 --> 00:48:00,471
is Director Jo Yu-jeong of Marine Group.

787
00:48:01,263 --> 00:48:02,222
Director Jo Yu-jeong?

788
00:48:02,306 --> 00:48:04,808
That's Ms. Jin Young-seo's cousin.
How could--

789
00:48:04,892 --> 00:48:06,768
They contacted me first.

790
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:11,106
They said that they thought Tae-moo
would be a good match for Director Jo.

791
00:48:12,107 --> 00:48:14,985
-What?
-I'm a bit worried

792
00:48:15,068 --> 00:48:16,570
how Chairman Jin will react,

793
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:21,241
but his younger sister,
Jin Chae-rim, is just as powerful.

794
00:48:22,618 --> 00:48:23,577
She'll be

795
00:48:24,411 --> 00:48:27,080
a good asset to you.

796
00:48:33,962 --> 00:48:34,796
President Kang.

797
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,881
What can I do

798
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:37,966
other than follow the Chairman's wishes?

799
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:41,428
Does that mean that you're going to
give up Ms. Shin?

800
00:48:48,227 --> 00:48:49,561
Oh, my.

801
00:48:49,645 --> 00:48:51,021
That must hurt a lot.

802
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:57,402
<i>A one-on-one dinner with President Kang?</i>

803
00:48:57,486 --> 00:48:59,988
That's amazing.
Dinner with President Kang!

804
00:49:00,072 --> 00:49:04,034
Right? I'm going to work extra hard today
to become the MVP.

805
00:49:04,117 --> 00:49:06,662
Says who? I'm going to be the MVP.

806
00:49:06,745 --> 00:49:08,121
No, it's going to be me.

807
00:49:09,248 --> 00:49:10,666
President Kang sure is popular.

808
00:49:24,221 --> 00:49:25,681
No!

809
00:49:25,764 --> 00:49:27,766
No? Not here? It's not there?

810
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:28,684
What?

811
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:29,768
Here.

812
00:49:33,522 --> 00:49:35,691
You can do it. Yes, you can do it.

813
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:37,526
Hui-gyu.

814
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,820
-Yes?
-You have to do well

815
00:49:39,903 --> 00:49:42,072
in Ms. Shin's place, okay?

816
00:49:42,656 --> 00:49:45,242
Well, I'm not that confident, but--

817
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:47,286
Come on!

818
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:49,955
We have to get the MVP title!

819
00:49:50,038 --> 00:49:52,291
Look at your eyes. Where are you looking?

820
00:49:52,374 --> 00:49:53,709
Look a bit fiercer.

821
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:56,461
Yes, that's right.
A meeting with President Kang.

822
00:49:56,545 --> 00:49:59,006
That'll lead to a promotion for sure.

823
00:49:59,089 --> 00:50:00,048
Yes, sir.

824
00:50:00,132 --> 00:50:01,049
Right.

825
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:02,384
Wait!

826
00:50:29,953 --> 00:50:31,038
Move.

827
00:50:31,747 --> 00:50:32,623
I'm going to do it.

828
00:50:33,915 --> 00:50:36,251
-Yes, you go and look fierce, okay?
-Yes, sir.

829
00:50:36,335 --> 00:50:37,544
Wait a second.

830
00:50:37,628 --> 00:50:39,004
Will you be okay, Ms. Shin?

831
00:50:39,087 --> 00:50:42,841
It's fine. It's do or die, right?

832
00:50:43,925 --> 00:50:45,344
I like that spirit. Let's go!

833
00:50:45,927 --> 00:50:47,220
Yes, let's do it!

834
00:50:47,304 --> 00:50:48,138
Yes!

835
00:50:48,221 --> 00:50:49,514
Let's go cheer Ha-ri on!

836
00:50:49,598 --> 00:50:50,932
Let's go!

837
00:50:51,016 --> 00:50:52,643
Okay, good luck.

838
00:50:53,226 --> 00:50:54,186
One, two, three.

839
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:55,395
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

840
00:51:08,325 --> 00:51:15,332
OPPOSING TEAM, HA-RI'S TEAM

841
00:51:25,425 --> 00:51:28,428
Right! Dodge to the right.
To the right! Yes!

842
00:51:28,512 --> 00:51:29,596
Hey! Dodge!

843
00:51:31,431 --> 00:51:33,392
Ms. Shin, look at my sign. My sign!

844
00:51:33,475 --> 00:51:35,519
You need to look at my sign, Ms. Shin.

845
00:51:35,602 --> 00:51:38,021
Spin, spin!

846
00:51:38,105 --> 00:51:39,731
Right, that's it! Good job!

847
00:51:39,815 --> 00:51:42,526
Catch! Get the ball!

848
00:51:44,903 --> 00:51:46,530
Ms. Shin is really going for it.

849
00:52:23,066 --> 00:52:24,484
Team White wins!

850
00:52:32,993 --> 00:52:36,329
Today's MVP is researcher Shin Ha-ri
from Food Product Development Team 1!

851
00:52:36,997 --> 00:52:37,831
Congratulations.

852
00:52:45,547 --> 00:52:47,257
FOOD PRODUCT RESEARCH TEAM FIELD DAY

853
00:52:47,841 --> 00:52:50,343
To our MVP, Ms. Shin!

854
00:52:50,427 --> 00:52:52,179
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

855
00:52:52,262 --> 00:52:54,222
-Good job.
-Congratulations

856
00:52:54,306 --> 00:52:56,224
Great work.

857
00:53:00,979 --> 00:53:04,024
That was impressive.
How did you become the MVP with that arm?

858
00:53:06,902 --> 00:53:10,739
You're really lucky this year.
The Mega Hit Award and the MVP?

859
00:53:10,822 --> 00:53:11,948
Treat us to a meal.

860
00:53:12,032 --> 00:53:14,367
Of course! I'll treat you all really well!

861
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:17,162
By the way, where's President Kang?

862
00:53:17,245 --> 00:53:18,246
I haven't seen him.

863
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:19,414
Didn't you hear?

864
00:53:19,498 --> 00:53:21,041
-He can't make it today.
-What?

865
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,877
-Why?
-He's going on a blind date

866
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,837
at Koryo Hotel today, at seven.

867
00:53:27,714 --> 00:53:28,548
A blind date?

868
00:53:29,049 --> 00:53:30,967
What about the woman in the picture?

869
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:34,304
Do you think he's the same as us?
They don't marry the people they date.

870
00:53:34,387 --> 00:53:36,973
Are they living
in the Joseon dynasty or something?

871
00:53:37,474 --> 00:53:39,142
I'm disappointed in President Kang.

872
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:04,793
Mr. Kang Tae-moo?

873
00:54:05,658 --> 00:54:07,452
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-<i>I reek of alcohol</i>

874
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,079
Get home safe!

875
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,247
I'll see you tomorrow.

876
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,211
The bus is here!
Ms. Shin, I'm going to head home then!

877
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,755
-Okay. Get home safe!
-Bye!

878
00:54:23,092 --> 00:54:24,302
Hello.

879
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:32,685
<i>ME AND YOU?</i>
A BOOK FOR THOSE HIDING YOUR FEELINGS

880
00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:41,402
And I won't give up.

881
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:44,280
If you reject me,
I'll ask you out again and again.

882
00:54:45,114 --> 00:54:46,824
Until you finally like me back.

883
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,495
What happened to that?

884
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:52,789
No.

885
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:56,292
I think I went crazy for a bit there.
Why did I…

886
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,044
Can we pretend that never happened?

887
00:54:58,127 --> 00:54:58,961
Let's…

888
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:00,797
See you tomorrow.

889
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:04,967
I mean,

890
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,428
I have no right.

891
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,226
I have feelings for you.

892
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:16,562
Thank you,
for letting me talk about it like this.

893
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:27,532
Taxi!

894
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,616
Here.

895
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:40,461
Sir, I'm sorry, but could you
drive a bit faster?

896
00:55:41,045 --> 00:55:41,921
I'm sorry.

897
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,345
SHIN HA-RI

898
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,058
Hello?

899
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,685
Get out of there, now.

900
00:55:55,768 --> 00:55:58,771
Do you even know where I am
to tell me that?

901
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,399
What do you mean, where?
You're at Koryo Hotel.

902
00:56:01,482 --> 00:56:02,316
What?

903
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,360
<i>How could you do something like that?</i>

904
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,946
<i>You made me fall for you</i>

905
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:08,740
and now you're going on a blind date?

906
00:56:10,074 --> 00:56:14,120
<i>You know, I was waiting
for your text all day,</i>

907
00:56:14,203 --> 00:56:16,038
<i>wondering when you would come by.</i>

908
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:19,500
<i>I was going crazy thinking about you
eating dinner with another woman.</i>

909
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,043
<i>How can you do that?</i>

910
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,670
I don't know anymore.

911
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,798
From now on, I'm not going to care
about what other people think

912
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,967
and just think about the two of us.

913
00:56:28,634 --> 00:56:29,844
<i>So…</i>

914
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,680
don't go on that blind date, Mr. Kang.

915
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,560
<i>Why aren't you saying anything?</i>

916
00:56:37,643 --> 00:56:40,146
You don't even want
to talk to me now, is that it?

917
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:41,189
No.

918
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,649
I just like that…

919
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,194
you're acting jealous.

920
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,281
Why would I go on a blind date
with another woman?

921
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,284
Did you think that lowly of me?

922
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,621
But I heard that you're going
on a blind date today--

923
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,331
I'm in front of your house.

924
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,417
I was going to ask you out again today.

925
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,212
Good thing I came.

926
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,442
The traffic…

927
00:57:34,283 --> 00:57:36,202
Excuse me, I'll get off here.

928
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,098
Ms. Shin.

929
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:01,978
If you come any closer,
I'm never going to let you go again.

930
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,282
You won't say
this is a mistake too, right?

931
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,578
I'll pay you back for that kiss

932
00:58:19,328 --> 00:58:20,663
with another kiss.

933
00:59:16,872 --> 00:59:23,498
