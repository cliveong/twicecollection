1
00:00:00,064 --> 00:00:04,906
BUSINESS PROPOSAL

2
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:55,843
You're up.

3
00:00:56,344 --> 00:00:58,054
Wake up. Let's have breakfast.

4
00:00:59,847 --> 00:01:04,602
Okay, but could you wait outside?
I'm embarrassed.

5
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,441
What?

6
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:18,700
Okay. Just go outside. I'll be right out.

7
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:20,535
I'm hungry, so be quick.

8
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:39,846
What's so wrong with checking
if my son-in-law could inherit my company?

9
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:44,517
Are you saying that you approve of
me dating Sung-hoon?

10
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,146
If I wasn't going to,
why would I have called him to dinner?

11
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,064
Will you marry me?

12
00:01:58,531 --> 00:01:59,574
This is Cha Sung-hoon.

13
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:01,117
Hey, this is Chairman Jin.

14
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:07,749
I won't beat around the bush.

15
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:09,208
Break up with my daughter.

16
00:02:10,418 --> 00:02:11,919
<i>Why aren't you saying anything?</i>

17
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:14,922
Did you not hear me telling you
to break up with Young-seo?

18
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:22,472
<i>Also, keep this a secret from Young-seo.
I'm sure you're smart enough to do that.</i>

19
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:47,789
Sung-hoon, I'm coming in.

20
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:56,464
You haven't eaten, right?
Let's go eat seaweed soup.

21
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:58,591
Ha-ri's parents are
making me a birthday meal.

22
00:02:58,674 --> 00:02:59,759
Ms. Shin's parents?

23
00:02:59,842 --> 00:03:02,261
They've celebrated
my birthday with me every year.

24
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:07,225
But Ha-ri used me as her cover story
to stay out last night.

25
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:09,393
I guess she was with Mr. Kang.

26
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:12,897
Are you all right, Young-seo?

27
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:14,857
What do you mean?

28
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:17,110
I'm fine.

29
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:20,738
Well, other than my lousy luck
with my parents,

30
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:23,157
I have so many people around me
who care about me.

31
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:27,912
My goodness.

32
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,293
Why are you worrying about me?

33
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:37,547
I should be the one
asking you if you're okay.

34
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:45,138
I'm sorry you're going through this
because of me.

35
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,433
Something's definitely fishy.

36
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:51,686
We're talking about that again?

37
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:55,940
We've been regulars at the rice cake shop
for ten years. They'd never deceive us.

38
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:58,568
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about Ha-ri.

39
00:03:58,651 --> 00:03:59,485
What about Ha-ri?

40
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:02,488
I think she was with President Kang
last night.

41
00:04:02,572 --> 00:04:06,367
Jeez, now you're talking nonsense.

42
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,912
Ha-ri isn't that kind of girl.

43
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:13,332
Do you think I lied to my parents
and went on a trip with you

44
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,001
because I was that kind of girl?

45
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:16,544
You talked me into--

46
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:18,462
Anyway!

47
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:21,382
Ha-ri isn't that kind of girl!

48
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:24,802
As a mother, you should trust
your child more.

49
00:04:24,886 --> 00:04:28,764
Well, I just don't want to
be betrayed by someone I trust!

50
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:30,266
I just have a weird feeling.

51
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:33,227
Whenever you say that you have
a weird feeling about something,

52
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:35,479
it turns out to be nothing.

53
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:38,232
Just trust our daughter.

54
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:39,525
My goodness.

55
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:43,487
Go on in, Ha-ri.

56
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:47,575
-Okay, I will.
-I really don't want to let you go.

57
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:49,577
Same here.

58
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:55,416
Hey, Shin Ha-ri!

59
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:56,834
Honey!

60
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:58,920
-Honey, honey!
-Shin Ha-ri!

61
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:01,464
You said you were
going to sleep over at Young-seo's,

62
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,549
but you spent the night with him?

63
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:07,386
-You crazy brat! You've gone insane!
-Calm down, honey!

64
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,014
Please calm down,
and let's talk it out, Mother.

65
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:11,849
"Mother"? Don't call me that!

66
00:05:12,558 --> 00:05:13,517
-You brat!
-Mom!

67
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,644
-Honey!
-Are you okay?

68
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:15,603
Yes, I'm fine.

69
00:05:15,686 --> 00:05:16,562
-You brat!
-Mom.

70
00:05:16,646 --> 00:05:18,522
How could you hit him?

71
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:20,691
Have some class! Use your words!

72
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:23,110
"Class"? Are you serious
right now? Come here!

73
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:24,320
-Come here!
-Stop it.

74
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:25,237
Stop what?

75
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:26,405
Come over here!

76
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:29,784
-Ha-ri, no!
-Come here!

77
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:31,702
-What?
-Ms. Han!

78
00:05:34,163 --> 00:05:38,292
Dad, I'm sorry for lying, but…

79
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:42,797
Father, Mother…

80
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:45,341
it's not Ha-ri's fault.

81
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:46,676
I'm the one to blame.

82
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,760
Mr. Kang.

83
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:49,178
Yes, sir.

84
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:50,137
KANG TAE-MOO

85
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,347
You're the president.

86
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,182
ENTREPRENEUR
PRESIDENT OF GO FOOD

87
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,934
How did you end up dating Ha-ri?

88
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:58,688
I fell in love with her at first sight

89
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:03,901
and I wanted to keep seeing her
so I kept using work as an excuse to meet.

90
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,363
That's how we ended up dating.

91
00:06:07,446 --> 00:06:10,574
Why would a man
who's so intimidatingly perfect like you

92
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:14,745
be head over heels in love with our Ha-ri?

93
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,998
In my eyes,

94
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,042
Ha-ri is the prettiest there is.

95
00:06:24,422 --> 00:06:27,842
I've met a lot of beautiful women

96
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:30,803
with impressive backgrounds.

97
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:34,181
But Ha-ri is the first woman I've met

98
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,768
who is a joy to be around
and always makes me laugh.

99
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:40,855
So I held onto her.

100
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:43,024
Does your family

101
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,985
know about Ha-ri?

102
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:50,114
They're probably not happy

103
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:53,284
about a boss dating his employee.

104
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:58,039
I believe
as long as we each do our job well,

105
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:00,249
there won't be a problem.

106
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,878
I will make sure
to get my family's approval.

107
00:07:04,587 --> 00:07:08,841
So, if you two would approve…

108
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:14,972
I would like to date Ha-ri
with marriage in mind.

109
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:24,023
Be quiet!

110
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:25,524
What are you so happy about?

111
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:27,151
You want to kneel here too?

112
00:07:27,234 --> 00:07:30,863
Well, I know I'm not
completely innocent here,

113
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,657
but could I please eat
before being scolded?

114
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:35,076
I'm just so hungry.

115
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,993
Yes, Mom.

116
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:37,995
It's Young-seo's birthday after all.

117
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,913
Right?

118
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:42,458
Gosh.

119
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:54,804
President Kang.

120
00:07:55,596 --> 00:08:00,309
I'm sorry for hitting you back there.

121
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,728
It wasn't on purpose.

122
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:05,606
I just got so angry
when I saw Ha-ri getting out of that car--

123
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,776
Enjoy the food.

124
00:08:11,278 --> 00:08:12,405
Eat.

125
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:17,284
Are you okay, Sung-hoon? Have some water.

126
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:20,287
Everyone!

127
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:22,289
It's my birthday!

128
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:25,376
Are you really going to be down like this?

129
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:28,337
Yes, why are you so down?
Ha-ri brought the top…

130
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:32,591
I mean, the best husband material.
We should be throwing a party.

131
00:08:32,675 --> 00:08:35,344
Yes. So both of you lighten up a bit.

132
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:37,513
I brought something for us to drink.

133
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:38,973
Sung-hoon.

134
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:42,309
What? Do you want
to drink in the middle of the day?

135
00:08:42,393 --> 00:08:43,352
It's champagne.

136
00:08:43,978 --> 00:08:47,231
I heard that you liked this last time,
so I got the same one.

137
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:50,901
How about we each have just one glass
to celebrate my birthday?

138
00:08:50,985 --> 00:08:53,112
We have to open up the store.

139
00:08:54,363 --> 00:08:57,116
Okay, maybe just one glass each?

140
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:59,493
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

141
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:00,911
President Kang.

142
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:02,997
Here, have a drink.

143
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:04,957
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:11,422
You can really hold your liquor.
That's nice to see.

145
00:09:12,173 --> 00:09:14,592
I don't know if you already know this,

146
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:17,261
but Ha-ri can really hold her liquor.

147
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:19,555
Mom, why would you mention that?

148
00:09:19,638 --> 00:09:21,515
What? You can drink three bottles easily.

149
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:24,477
-Three? She can do four. I saw it.
-It's not true!

150
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,603
-Right, right.
-No.

151
00:09:25,686 --> 00:09:26,687
-Water.
-Oh, water?

152
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:28,647
You must be happy.

153
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:30,483
My dear Young-seo, happy birthday!

154
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:31,400
What do you mean?

155
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:32,610
Ms. Shin's mother.

156
00:09:33,194 --> 00:09:34,820
I think she really likes you.

157
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:36,989
-Really?
-By the way, Ha-ri,

158
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:37,907
What?

159
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:40,534
where's my birthday present?

160
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:43,412
Why don't you go talk to her dad?

161
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:44,997
-I have a question.
-Okay, ask.

162
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,207
Right now?

163
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,626
You should get on his good side.

164
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:49,877
-Go on.
-Give me a kiss.

165
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,003
Come on!

166
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:54,548
You want to know a secret?

167
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:56,300
-Mom, you want to know?
-What?

168
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:59,428
About three years ago,
Ha-min called me when he was drunk.

169
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:01,222
You brat, you drunk-dialed her?

170
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:04,350
-Why did you call me when you were drunk?
-That's all in the past.

171
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:05,809
Did you hit on her?

172
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:06,727
My goodness.

173
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,395
-Mom, you--
-Hey, you.

174
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:11,357
How dare you flirt with a woman
who's older than you?

175
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,026
Hey, I'm practically your sister.
Why did you do that?

176
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:26,956
Father.

177
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:30,042
Why did you come down to the store?

178
00:10:33,337 --> 00:10:36,799
I just wanted to check on something.

179
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:38,884
I understand

180
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:41,512
that you're angry at me.

181
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,640
But, sir, I--

182
00:10:46,058 --> 00:10:47,559
I'm not…

183
00:10:49,645 --> 00:10:50,980
angry at you, Mr. Kang.

184
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:52,398
Pardon?

185
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:55,651
You know, Ha-ri…

186
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:58,487
She's been a great singer
since she was young,

187
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,240
so I asked her
if she wanted to be a singer.

188
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:03,284
But she said no.

189
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:08,247
Then in high school, she got a lead role

190
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,042
as soon as she joined the theater club

191
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,461
and even got an award.

192
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:18,424
So I asked her
if she wanted to be an actor.

193
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:22,720
But she said no again.
That it was just a hobby.

194
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:25,180
Then I found out…

195
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:29,601
she was only holding back

196
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:31,854
from doing those things

197
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,400
because I wasn't able to provide for her.

198
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:38,402
And now that little girl…

199
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:42,489
is seeing someone as incredible as you.

200
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:44,533
I'm just worried…

201
00:11:48,203 --> 00:11:51,332
that people might compare the two of you

202
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:55,753
because of her parents.

203
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,759
That will hurt her feelings.

204
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:05,888
Let me ask you one thing.

205
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:11,352
Are you sure Ha-ri won't get hurt…

206
00:12:14,063 --> 00:12:17,274
and won't have to suffer?

207
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,695
If I said that I was sure,

208
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:23,947
I would be lying.

209
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:30,496
I know that she could
get a lot of unwanted attention

210
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:34,500
or be the subject of rumors
just because she's seeing me.

211
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:39,546
No matter how hard I try,
I can't stop all of that.

212
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:41,256
But…

213
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:44,676
I promise I will always be by her side

214
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,346
and protect her
with everything that I have.

215
00:12:49,264 --> 00:12:51,934
I will be someone who stands by her

216
00:12:53,227 --> 00:12:54,853
and understands her.

217
00:12:56,146 --> 00:12:59,650
So please, could you trust the two of us

218
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,113
and root for us?

219
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:20,587
<i>Mother.</i>

220
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:22,673
<i>Don't call me your mother.</i>

221
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:23,841
<i>BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI</i>

222
00:13:23,924 --> 00:13:28,095
<i>I abandoned you,
and I tried to ruin your life.</i>

223
00:13:28,637 --> 00:13:29,638
What?

224
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:31,515
-Wait…
-<i>I'll make sure that Geum-hui…</i>

225
00:13:31,598 --> 00:13:34,309
Why is Geum-hui calling her "mother"?

226
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:37,521
It seems I've missed a lot.

227
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:38,772
<i>I mean, Mother.</i>

228
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:42,067
It turned out that Geum-hui
is the daughter she abandoned

229
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:45,279
before getting married
into that rich family.

230
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:46,739
What?

231
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:51,910
Then she yelled at Geum-hui all this time
without knowing that she's her daughter?

232
00:13:52,536 --> 00:13:54,496
Unbelievable.

233
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:57,249
I'm home.

234
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:02,421
Where have you been
when you're not even fully recovered?

235
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:05,090
I'm fine now, so don't worry.

236
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:08,844
You were with Ms. Shin or whatever, right?

237
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:12,765
So you're not going to give up on her

238
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:15,309
no matter how much I disapprove.

239
00:14:15,392 --> 00:14:18,103
When have you ever been
able to change my mind, Grandfather?

240
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:19,688
What? You brat.

241
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:22,524
Grandfather, I'm going to marry Ha-ri.

242
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:25,736
I'm actually coming back
from meeting her parents.

243
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:27,821
So…

244
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:30,282
just give up, Grandfather.

245
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:32,993
That little…

246
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,706
My chest. Gosh.

247
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:40,751
It hurts.

248
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:43,086
That little brat…

249
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:55,349
<i>The door is closing.</i>

250
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:58,060
<i>The door is opening.</i>

251
00:14:58,143 --> 00:14:59,186
Aren't you getting in?

252
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:14,952
Hey.

253
00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:16,411
What are you doing?

254
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,835
The two of them are dating, right?

255
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,713
So they say.

256
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:33,595
How can President Kang act
so nonchalantly, then?

257
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:39,768
Wasn't Team 1 in charge
of the cilantro dumplings?

258
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:41,812
Another team took it over.

259
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:48,151
Our team dropped out of the project
as Chairman Kang ordered, sir.

260
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:49,778
Have your team resume the project.

261
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:53,031
Your team has handled it until now,
so you should see it to the end.

262
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:55,158
Yes, President Kang.

263
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:56,076
Thank you.

264
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:06,587
-Aren't you getting out, Mr. Cha?
-Sir?

265
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:11,300
President Kang,
the tenth floor is our team's office.

266
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,393
I'm going to walk upstairs.
I need to think about my health.

267
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:25,439
Let's go up to the 17th floor, Mr. Cha.

268
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:31,111
I always work out, though.

269
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:36,909
Sir. This way.

270
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:39,369
Right.

271
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:41,371
Stay healthy, sir.

272
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:55,761
I ordered tea for you, instead of coffee.

273
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:58,096
They have your favorite, rooibos tea.

274
00:16:59,723 --> 00:17:01,433
What brings you here so early?

275
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:02,809
President Kang asked me

276
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:05,103
to do another collaboration,

277
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:07,814
saying we shouldn't worry
about the rumors.

278
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:11,234
But I'm just coming back
from telling him I can't do it.

279
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:12,819
Why? It's a great opportunity.

280
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:15,072
If it's because of me, don't do that.

281
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:16,531
Actually, I…

282
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,953
I'm closing my restaurant
and going to Europe.

283
00:17:21,036 --> 00:17:22,996
So suddenly?

284
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:25,499
Are you going with Yoo-ra?

285
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:26,500
We broke up.

286
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:29,169
We should have done this ages ago.

287
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:31,797
But I think we mistook
our regrets for affection.

288
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:36,093
Yoo-ra asked me to tell you she's sorry.

289
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,303
She couldn't face you herself.

290
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:43,266
How long will you be traveling?

291
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:46,103
I just got a one-way ticket
to Naples for now.

292
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:49,272
I'll visit a bunch of places
in Italy, eat a lot of delicious food,

293
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:52,025
and when my money runs out,
I'll get a job at a restaurant.

294
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:56,238
You know that
it's been on my bucket list for a while.

295
00:17:56,321 --> 00:17:59,032
Of course. It's been your dream
since you were in college.

296
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:01,451
I don't know when I'll come back,

297
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:03,370
but…

298
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:05,038
I'll see you again.

299
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:08,417
Okay. Take care of yourself.

300
00:18:09,126 --> 00:18:10,669
Ha-ri.

301
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:12,671
When I come back from my trip,

302
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,589
do you think that we could

303
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:18,093
go back to being
close friends like before?

304
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:25,726
That will

305
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:29,104
take some time, don't you think?

306
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:32,566
You know…

307
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:36,111
I started liking rooibos tea…

308
00:18:37,988 --> 00:18:39,531
because of you.

309
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:42,409
Because you like it,

310
00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:47,873
I started drinking it too,
and I took a liking to it.

311
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:51,793
After some time…

312
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,965
when I longer have any feelings for you

313
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,469
and when I'm not someone you see so often…

314
00:19:01,678 --> 00:19:03,138
Maybe then we could

315
00:19:04,347 --> 00:19:06,224
become friends again.

316
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:09,853
Okay.

317
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:12,564
Let's see each other again then.

318
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:14,649
My friend.

319
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:20,697
Okay. Take care of yourself.

320
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:23,325
I will.

321
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:44,012
Here.

322
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:48,683
I was about to call you.

323
00:19:49,392 --> 00:19:52,562
I was thinking it's about time
we made you a director.

324
00:19:52,646 --> 00:19:54,356
You can do as well as Yu-jeong, right?

325
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:56,316
We really don't see eye to eye.

326
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,903
The day you want
to appoint me as a director,

327
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:01,780
I've come to hand in my resignation.

328
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:02,906
I'm sorry.

329
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:08,203
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

330
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:16,336
Did Mr. Cha tell you?

331
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:18,213
Don't jump to conclusions.

332
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:21,216
I was there when you were
on the phone with Sung-hoon.

333
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,301
And I overheard it.

334
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:24,261
So…

335
00:20:24,886 --> 00:20:26,138
what's the meaning of this?

336
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:30,392
You're going to cut ties with your father
because of some good-for-nothing guy?

337
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:32,602
No, that's not it, Dad.

338
00:20:32,686 --> 00:20:34,229
It's not because of him.

339
00:20:34,312 --> 00:20:36,690
It's because of you,
since you only care about money.

340
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:39,276
-What?
-Do you know how embarrassed

341
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:41,111
and sorry I was in front of Sung-hoon?

342
00:20:42,028 --> 00:20:44,239
What have you ever done for me, Dad?

343
00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:47,367
You kicked Mom out
because she wasn't up to your standards

344
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,619
and you want to separate me
from the man I love.

345
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:53,206
You don't think of me as your daughter.

346
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:56,001
I'm just something you own, aren't I?

347
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:58,378
You got the worst qualities
from your mother.

348
00:20:58,461 --> 00:21:00,797
You have such a narrow point of view.

349
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:02,424
I've done nothing for you?

350
00:21:02,507 --> 00:21:05,927
Do you think you can do anything without
the privilege my name has given you?

351
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:08,763
Actually…

352
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:11,266
I think I can.

353
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,103
And I'll prove it.

354
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:20,317
That I'll be perfectly fine on my own,
without using your name.

355
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:29,826
I truly thank you
for raising me for all these years.

356
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:38,919
Did you even know it was my birthday?

357
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:03,151
Is that a new recipe?

358
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:05,987
What are you doing?

359
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:09,741
No matter how much you miss me,
you can't come in here!

360
00:22:10,617 --> 00:22:12,661
What if the other employees see us?

361
00:22:12,744 --> 00:22:14,287
I'm not here as your boyfriend.

362
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:17,374
I'm here as your boss to see
how our new products are coming along.

363
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,085
I see.

364
00:22:20,752 --> 00:22:21,586
Yes, sir.

365
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:24,005
How is it going?

366
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:30,679
You increased the amount of cilantro.

367
00:22:30,762 --> 00:22:32,931
Yes, sir. I increased
the ratio of the spices,

368
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:35,600
but I'm worried
that some people may not like it.

369
00:22:35,684 --> 00:22:38,895
I think this is better
than being too plain and forgettable.

370
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:40,438
I think so too, but--

371
00:22:40,522 --> 00:22:41,564
Yes, Ms. Yeo.

372
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:44,067
I'm in front of the kitchen right now.

373
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,736
-Oh, my God! Ms. Kim's coming!
-What?

374
00:22:48,738 --> 00:22:50,115
Why--

375
00:22:50,198 --> 00:22:52,367
Yes, I'll tell Ms. Shin.

376
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:56,287
What? She's not here.

377
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:58,164
Did she go to the bathroom?

378
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,752
Why are we hiding?
We weren't doing anything weird--

379
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:06,006
It's weird we're by ourselves
during work hours in the first place.

380
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:07,632
Ms. Shin.

381
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:14,222
-<i>Hye-ji</i>.
-What?

382
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:16,474
-<i>I'm at the cafe in your lobby.</i>
-Oh, my God.

383
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:18,059
<i>Could you come down for a second?</i>

384
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:21,855
But my face is so dry
because I couldn't sleep last night!

385
00:23:37,787 --> 00:23:38,788
There we go.

386
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:41,124
My face is shiny now.

387
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:42,584
Oh, right. Ms. Shin.

388
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:45,170
Whatever.

389
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:59,851
Stop laughing.
Do you know how nervous I was?

390
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:02,312
How about this?

391
00:24:08,443 --> 00:24:10,111
Will you stop?

392
00:24:11,404 --> 00:24:12,489
One second.

393
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:16,451
Yes, Director Go.

394
00:24:16,534 --> 00:24:19,662
<i>President Kang, I have bad news.
Chairman Kang has collapsed.</i>

395
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:22,040
What?

396
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:26,336
His blood pressure rose
after our lunch meeting.

397
00:24:27,295 --> 00:24:31,174
We brought him to Kangsung Hospital.

398
00:24:31,257 --> 00:24:33,593
<i>Please come quickly.
We're at Kangsung Hospital!</i>

399
00:24:33,676 --> 00:24:35,428
Okay, I'll be right there.

400
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,264
<i>What did he say?</i>

401
00:24:38,348 --> 00:24:41,101
<i>Did he seem surprised
when he heard that I was hospitalized?</i>

402
00:24:41,184 --> 00:24:43,812
<i>Yes, he was.
He said he'll come right away.</i>

403
00:24:44,521 --> 00:24:46,898
What can he do? He thinks I've collapsed!

404
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:49,818
He needs to break up with that girl.

405
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:50,902
Of course!

406
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:56,533
Professor Kim,
run every test that you have

407
00:24:56,616 --> 00:24:58,785
so Tae-moo gets scared. Okay?

408
00:24:58,868 --> 00:25:00,537
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

409
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,122
-It's my turn, right?
-Yes, sir.

410
00:25:02,205 --> 00:25:04,374
I think you're going to lose.

411
00:25:04,457 --> 00:25:05,416
PRESIDENT KANG TAE-MOO

412
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,960
<i>Oh, this is--</i>

413
00:25:09,838 --> 00:25:12,090
I'm glad that he's not actually sick.

414
00:25:13,716 --> 00:25:15,760
This isn't going to work.

415
00:25:20,515 --> 00:25:22,684
I'm so bored.

416
00:25:24,936 --> 00:25:26,437
It's so stuffy here.

417
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:28,314
Those bastards…

418
00:25:33,987 --> 00:25:35,113
Why isn't this opening?

419
00:25:37,574 --> 00:25:38,741
What?

420
00:25:40,493 --> 00:25:41,327
Damn it.

421
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:50,420
My head.

422
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:52,964
My goodness.

423
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:56,551
Oh, my.

424
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:01,306
What? What are you doing here?

425
00:26:02,265 --> 00:26:04,934
How dare you show up here?

426
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:09,564
Hello. I brought some books and clothes
from your house.

427
00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:13,610
President Kang has an important meeting,
so he sent me here in his place.

428
00:26:13,693 --> 00:26:14,777
Look here.

429
00:26:14,861 --> 00:26:17,071
You're the reason that I collapsed!

430
00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:21,451
I might pass out again from anger
if I keep looking at your face,

431
00:26:21,993 --> 00:26:23,161
so go away!

432
00:26:24,078 --> 00:26:25,455
My goodness.

433
00:26:32,212 --> 00:26:34,631
-Let me open it for you.
-Damn this thing.

434
00:26:34,714 --> 00:26:36,299
I'll get it for you, sir.

435
00:26:37,842 --> 00:26:38,968
There we go.

436
00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:40,595
Ta-da!

437
00:26:41,387 --> 00:26:45,058
I told you to leave!

438
00:26:48,853 --> 00:26:51,356
Do you need to go to the bathroom?
Let me help you.

439
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:53,691
I don't need it!

440
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,985
I told you to go!

441
00:26:58,363 --> 00:26:59,405
My gosh.

442
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:00,615
Are you all right?

443
00:27:00,698 --> 00:27:03,743
Didn't you collapse
because of your high blood pressure?

444
00:27:05,453 --> 00:27:07,288
It's not high blood pressure.

445
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:11,417
Right now, I just have a cramp in my leg…

446
00:27:11,501 --> 00:27:12,335
What?

447
00:27:14,045 --> 00:27:15,755
Let go. I'm fine.

448
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:20,343
Let me help you even if you don't like it.

449
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:23,179
If you collapse again,
then you'll really be in trouble.

450
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:26,557
-I'm really fine.
-My goodness.

451
00:27:27,642 --> 00:27:28,601
Let's go.

452
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:31,187
<i>This isn't how it's supposed to go…</i>

453
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:37,402
Take your time.

454
00:27:44,492 --> 00:27:46,828
I'm glad that he's not actually sick.

455
00:27:46,911 --> 00:27:49,080
This isn't going to work.

456
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,877
How about I go to the hospital myself?

457
00:27:55,837 --> 00:27:57,839
-What?
-He really liked me

458
00:27:57,922 --> 00:27:59,924
when he thought I was Geum-hui.

459
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:01,050
Who knows?

460
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:04,721
He might start liking me again
if we spend some time together.

461
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:07,932
Right?

462
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:14,856
I'll just be here
until President Kang gets here, sir.

463
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:18,276
Unbelievable.

464
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:31,372
Did you just get off work?
Come in, let's eat together.

465
00:28:36,586 --> 00:28:39,964
It was your birthday, but I didn't
get to cook you a birthday meal.

466
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:41,424
Sit.

467
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:43,968
What?

468
00:28:44,594 --> 00:28:46,471
Did you make all of this yourself?

469
00:28:47,013 --> 00:28:48,056
Just the seaweed soup.

470
00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:50,683
I'm not a very good cook
so I ordered the rest.

471
00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:53,561
Come on, try some.

472
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:02,236
I followed the recipe exactly
but I'm not sure if you'll like it.

473
00:29:04,947 --> 00:29:06,074
It's good.

474
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:08,576
It's really good.

475
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:13,164
What's wrong?

476
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,292
Did something happen at work?

477
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,589
I gave my father
my letter of resignation today.

478
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,926
I thought it would feel good,

479
00:29:25,843 --> 00:29:28,805
that I would be okay
with never seeing him again, but…

480
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:35,687
Young-seo.

481
00:29:36,938 --> 00:29:39,399
Still, don't hate my father too much.

482
00:29:39,482 --> 00:29:42,360
The more a person has,
the more greedy they become.

483
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:48,408
I'll be even better to you
from now on, Sung-hoon.

484
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:50,576
Okay?

485
00:30:18,187 --> 00:30:21,274
What are you going to do
now that you're unemployed?

486
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:25,194
I'm going to start a company
under my name.

487
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:26,738
When did you think of that?

488
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:28,406
It's always been my dream.

489
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:32,535
I wanted to start my own company
with a single unique idea at its core.

490
00:30:32,618 --> 00:30:35,997
I've always thought about it
and I'm doing it earlier than I planned.

491
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,291
But you'll need quite a lot of money.

492
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:41,669
So I'm going to use
the severance pay that I got

493
00:30:41,753 --> 00:30:43,921
and take out some loans.

494
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:49,093
Hold on.

495
00:30:49,177 --> 00:30:50,178
What?

496
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:03,983
What's this?

497
00:31:05,943 --> 00:31:09,655
BALANCE
1,700,600,000 WON

498
00:31:10,406 --> 00:31:12,784
It's the money Chairman Kang gave me

499
00:31:12,867 --> 00:31:15,578
and some of the stock I own.
Use it to start your company.

500
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:17,872
It's fine.

501
00:31:17,955 --> 00:31:21,209
It's a lot of money and couples
shouldn't be lending each other money

502
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:23,252
That's not what I'm doing.

503
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:26,464
I'll be the first person
to invest in your company.

504
00:31:28,591 --> 00:31:31,219
-You mean it?
-You know I'm picky, right?

505
00:31:32,386 --> 00:31:34,680
Bring me a proper business plan first.

506
00:31:34,764 --> 00:31:36,307
If I'm happy with that

507
00:31:36,974 --> 00:31:38,351
then I'll invest in full.

508
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:40,144
Sung-hoon.

509
00:31:41,604 --> 00:31:42,980
Thank you.

510
00:31:43,064 --> 00:31:45,691
You can't just
try to gloss over it like this.

511
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:47,109
I want a business plan.

512
00:31:47,193 --> 00:31:48,569
Don't worry.

513
00:31:56,953 --> 00:32:01,624
Wait. Isn't she supposed
to be taking care of me? Where is she?

514
00:32:01,707 --> 00:32:03,042
My goodness.

515
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,674
Chairman Kang.

516
00:32:10,258 --> 00:32:11,801
Since it's cold outside,

517
00:32:12,385 --> 00:32:14,011
here's some <i>ssanghwa</i> tea.

518
00:32:19,892 --> 00:32:21,477
I got this from a cafe nearby

519
00:32:21,561 --> 00:32:24,897
because I heard they make
proper <i>ssanghwa</i> tea.

520
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:28,776
And it's so good.

521
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:31,404
It's amazing.

522
00:32:32,238 --> 00:32:33,072
Try it, sir.

523
00:32:33,155 --> 00:32:37,201
Well, how good could it be?
It's just <i>ssanghwa</i> tea.

524
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,744
Wait.

525
00:32:40,496 --> 00:32:41,706
Here…

526
00:32:45,793 --> 00:32:48,921
They said if I put the yolk in too early,
it'd overcook, so…

527
00:32:50,298 --> 00:32:51,257
Really?

528
00:33:01,475 --> 00:33:05,021
This is the real deal.
It's perfect for the weather right now.

529
00:33:05,104 --> 00:33:06,606
Right?

530
00:33:20,161 --> 00:33:22,538
I'm glad that it's to your liking, sir.

531
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:25,333
What do you mean? It wasn't that great.

532
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:28,628
Let's just watch some TV.

533
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:32,465
How pretty.

534
00:33:32,548 --> 00:33:34,133
All-natural.

535
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:35,468
That's red seabream, right?

536
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:37,720
-<i>It's red seabream!</i>
-How do you know that?

537
00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:42,725
Of course. I researched all sorts of fish
when I made our fish stew products.

538
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:45,436
That's pretty big for a red seabream.

539
00:33:46,187 --> 00:33:48,856
You're calling that tiny little thing big?

540
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,524
Have you caught a bigger one?

541
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:51,901
Of course.

542
00:33:51,984 --> 00:33:56,322
Back in the day,
I even caught a shark once.

543
00:33:56,405 --> 00:33:58,991
A shark? Like an actual shark? Really?

544
00:33:59,075 --> 00:34:02,078
Of course! Do you not believe me?

545
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:04,997
It was even bigger than I am.

546
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:06,791
It was probably as big as this bed.

547
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:08,376
I think it weighed 80 or 90kg.

548
00:34:08,459 --> 00:34:10,753
You're pulling my leg, aren't you?

549
00:34:10,836 --> 00:34:13,881
Jeez. Do you want to see some proof?

550
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:17,259
My goodness.

551
00:34:19,345 --> 00:34:20,304
There!

552
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:22,515
See?

553
00:34:25,184 --> 00:34:28,187
Is that really you? You caught that?

554
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,107
Of course I caught it. Who else… Come on.

555
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,359
Do you have any other pictures?

556
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:38,322
Now, that's what I call a red seabream.

557
00:34:38,406 --> 00:34:40,533
What is that?
That thing's just a little baby.

558
00:34:40,616 --> 00:34:42,576
You're right! It's a baby!

559
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,081
I'll tell you what. When you go overseas,
sharks are very common.

560
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:49,166
But you saw that picture, right?

561
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,877
I was on this small rock,
with just a fishing pole,

562
00:34:51,961 --> 00:34:53,921
and I was fighting that shark
all by myself!

563
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:55,423
Not everyone can do that.

564
00:34:55,506 --> 00:34:56,340
Oh, my God.

565
00:34:56,424 --> 00:34:58,342
You can't get that anywhere…

566
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:02,263
You're a professional!

567
00:35:02,346 --> 00:35:04,765
Damn it, what am I doing?

568
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:07,184
Anyway…

569
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:12,565
I don't want to talk to you anymore,
so just quietly watch TV.

570
00:35:12,648 --> 00:35:13,983
<i>That's amazing.</i>

571
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:17,111
-Yes, sir.
-<i>That looks delicious.</i>

572
00:35:26,245 --> 00:35:30,833
<i>Crossing Youngdong Bridge alone</i>

573
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:35,254
<i>In the night rain</i>

574
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:39,175
<i>He probably doesn't know</i>

575
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:42,595
<i>He probably doesn't know how it feels</i>

576
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:45,181
Oh, my parents really like this song.

577
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,725
I didn't say anything.

578
00:35:53,773 --> 00:35:55,691
I really like this part.

579
00:35:56,275 --> 00:36:00,404
<i>Regret, regret, regret</i>

580
00:36:00,488 --> 00:36:03,783
<i>It's probably regret</i>

581
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:09,955
It's a habit. I always sing along
when I'm watching TV with my parents.

582
00:36:10,706 --> 00:36:12,416
I was being loud again, wasn't I?

583
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,459
No.

584
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:18,798
I'm old and hard of hearing.
It wasn't loud at all.

585
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:22,802
If you want to sing along, go ahead.

586
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:25,554
I don't mind at all.

587
00:36:27,389 --> 00:36:28,224
Yes, sir.

588
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:34,480
<i>Wandering around Youngdong Bridge alone</i>

589
00:36:34,563 --> 00:36:37,983

00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:45,533

00:36:46,826 --> 00:36:51,539

595

VIP SUITE 1701
MR. KANG **-GOO

596
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,980
Thanks.

597
00:37:22,736 --> 00:37:25,531
Thank you. Grandfather gave you
a hard time, didn't he?

598
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:30,035
I volunteered to come here. It's okay.

599
00:37:32,746 --> 00:37:34,206
But why do you look so down?

600
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:40,838
You know, I'm usually super popular
with people who are over 60.

601
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:43,716
Young-seo even teased me
about it one time,

602
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:46,010
calling me the Nursing Home Celebrity.

603
00:37:47,803 --> 00:37:50,306
But it didn't really work…

604
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:52,975
on your grandfather.

605
00:37:55,394 --> 00:37:58,272
You're popular with me.
I think you're being too greedy.

606
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:00,941
I'm not in a joking mood right now.

607
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:04,570
Let's take it slow.

608
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:06,697
There's no need to rush things.

609
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,491
President Kang.

610
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:11,035
Professor Kim.

611
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,748
I'm sorry about my grandfather.

612
00:38:15,831 --> 00:38:16,957
Not at all.

613
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:19,543
It would've been worse
if he hadn't gotten the checkup.

614
00:38:19,627 --> 00:38:20,502
Pardon?

615
00:38:21,754 --> 00:38:22,838
What do you…

616
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:36,894
Why won't they let me leave the hospital?

617
00:38:37,937 --> 00:38:40,856
Professor Kim wants to
run some more tests.

618
00:38:42,316 --> 00:38:45,861
Sung-hoon, I'm fine.

619
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:47,529
I feel great.

620
00:38:47,613 --> 00:38:51,450
I was just putting on a show
when I said I was sick.

621
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:54,203
Tell him that he can let me go, okay?

622
00:38:56,413 --> 00:38:59,041
I'm sorry, sir.
Please just wait one more day.

623
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:03,379
I guess I've put myself in this position.

624
00:39:03,462 --> 00:39:04,546
My goodness.

625
00:39:05,297 --> 00:39:07,299
Doctor Kim, that bastard, I'm going to--

626
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:10,219
Chairman Kang can't handle
any more operations.

627
00:39:11,595 --> 00:39:14,348
Then are there
any other treatment options?

628
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:17,434
They've developed
stents coated with stem cells,

629
00:39:18,018 --> 00:39:19,311
But, in Korea…

630
00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:21,272
What about Korea?

631
00:39:21,772 --> 00:39:23,148
What are you talking about?

632
00:39:23,649 --> 00:39:25,651
What operation?

633
00:39:26,235 --> 00:39:27,236
What treatment?

634
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:28,153
Sir.

635
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,616
Tae-moo, what's going on?

636
00:39:46,547 --> 00:39:49,925
There's a problem with the stent
that was inserted into your heart vessel.

637
00:39:50,843 --> 00:39:52,845
The inner walls of the vessel are damaged.

638
00:39:52,928 --> 00:39:55,306
And since you've had the surgery
several times,

639
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:58,058
<i>I don't think
your body can withstand more surgery.</i>

640
00:40:04,106 --> 00:40:05,065
Grandfather.

641
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:08,402
Yes.

642
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,782
You should have told me
that you were going fishing.

643
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,869
It would have been better
to come in the same car.

644
00:40:16,952 --> 00:40:21,040
You usually never listen to me
when I ask you to go fishing with me.

645
00:40:21,123 --> 00:40:24,543
It's been a while since we did this.
Do you want to bet on who catches more?

646
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:29,465
There's no way that
the two of you can beat me, punks.

647
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:31,592
You won't know until we actually try it.

648
00:40:31,675 --> 00:40:32,634
Sure.

649
00:40:49,193 --> 00:40:50,694
Don't worry.

650
00:40:51,362 --> 00:40:54,114
I will cure your illness.

651
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,243
Don't be cheeky.

652
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,997
No matter how much you've grown,

653
00:41:02,623 --> 00:41:04,666
you're still my grandson.

654
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:09,254
I can take care of my own illness.

655
00:41:09,797 --> 00:41:11,757
You've always been a mountain to us.

656
00:41:12,883 --> 00:41:14,843
Please be healthy and stay that way,

657
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:19,431
Grandfather.

658
00:41:25,604 --> 00:41:27,773
Being sick is kind of nice.

659
00:41:28,857 --> 00:41:30,192
I never thought

660
00:41:30,943 --> 00:41:33,070
I would hear you call me that.

661
00:42:02,224 --> 00:42:03,892
When did you get back?

662
00:42:07,855 --> 00:42:10,941
How's Chairman Kang?

663
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,571
There's a problem with his blood vessels,

664
00:42:16,363 --> 00:42:18,323
but there's no treatment in Korea yet.

665
00:42:19,908 --> 00:42:20,784
So…

666
00:42:23,036 --> 00:42:26,707
I'm going to take him to the States.

667
00:42:30,335 --> 00:42:32,087
Speaking of which, Ha-ri,

668
00:42:33,797 --> 00:42:35,799
will you come with me?

669
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:42,431
I know that it's selfish

670
00:42:43,056 --> 00:42:45,350
and I know it's a lot to ask of you.

671
00:42:46,185 --> 00:42:47,644
But I want you

672
00:42:48,604 --> 00:42:50,606
by my side.

673
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:54,610
I'm not telling you to quit your job.

674
00:42:55,402 --> 00:42:58,322
There's that program we have,
where we send researchers overseas.

675
00:42:58,906 --> 00:43:01,992
If you apply for that, I'm sure you will--

676
00:43:06,246 --> 00:43:07,164
No.

677
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,834
I'm sure I'd get it, though.

678
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,544
But…

679
00:43:13,462 --> 00:43:14,963
if I do that,

680
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,883
there will be rumors about it
at the company.

681
00:43:17,966 --> 00:43:19,843
Don't worry about other people.

682
00:43:19,927 --> 00:43:22,012
I don't care about other people, either.

683
00:43:22,804 --> 00:43:23,805
I just…

684
00:43:25,307 --> 00:43:26,558
don't want

685
00:43:27,935 --> 00:43:31,939
this situation to hurt you anymore.

686
00:43:40,614 --> 00:43:42,241
Ha-ri, I'm so worried.

687
00:43:46,578 --> 00:43:48,163
My grandfather is…

688
00:43:50,707 --> 00:43:51,833
both my father

689
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,920
and mother.

690
00:43:56,588 --> 00:43:58,173
But if something…

691
00:44:01,885 --> 00:44:03,845
happens to him…

692
00:44:18,735 --> 00:44:19,653
I know.

693
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,865
That's all the more reason
why I can't go with you.

694
00:44:26,243 --> 00:44:30,080
Chairman Kang's health is
the most important thing right now.

695
00:44:31,498 --> 00:44:33,667
He still doesn't approve of me.

696
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,129
So how could I possibly go with you?

697
00:44:41,717 --> 00:44:42,926
I'm sorry.

698
00:44:44,594 --> 00:44:46,471
I know it all…

699
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:49,516
but I couldn't help it.

700
00:44:50,225 --> 00:44:52,686
I understand how you feel.

701
00:44:59,484 --> 00:45:01,236
Will we be okay away from each other?

702
00:45:02,904 --> 00:45:05,240
What? Are we never going
to see each other again?

703
00:45:05,324 --> 00:45:06,199
No.

704
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:07,993
Then why are you saying it like that?

705
00:45:08,994 --> 00:45:11,747
Other people might think
we're breaking up right now.

706
00:45:19,004 --> 00:45:20,922
I'll be back before you know it.

707
00:45:22,883 --> 00:45:24,301
So wait for me here.

708
00:45:25,802 --> 00:45:26,762
Okay?

709
00:45:28,847 --> 00:45:29,931
Okay.

710
00:45:41,147 --> 00:45:42,857
1 YEAR LATER

711
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,775
GO FOOD COMPANY RECORDS
2 TRILLION WON IN SALES

712
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:47,778
Do you think
we'll get a bonus this quarter?

713
00:45:47,862 --> 00:45:49,113
A bonus?

714
00:45:50,031 --> 00:45:50,906
What bonus?

715
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,908
Our dumplings that entered the US market

716
00:45:52,992 --> 00:45:55,161
took the majority share
in the global market.

717
00:45:55,244 --> 00:45:57,038
Our <i>Danji</i> Kimchi was a huge hit, too.

718
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,080
That's right.

719
00:45:58,164 --> 00:46:02,209
I heard that go food's sales
just rose to two trillion won.

720
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:03,502
Strictly speaking,

721
00:46:03,586 --> 00:46:06,547
we already developed those items
before you all got hired.

722
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:07,715
But what, a bonus?

723
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:09,967
A bonus?

724
00:46:24,357 --> 00:46:26,442
They have to give it to us. They will!

725
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:27,985
Really?

726
00:46:29,612 --> 00:46:32,281
-You've all worked so hard.
-I'm so happy.

727
00:46:32,365 --> 00:46:33,824
Development Team 1!

728
00:46:35,242 --> 00:46:36,077
Is this

729
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:39,497
all that your team's capable of?

730
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,999
What's wrong? What did we do?

731
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:45,294
You know Team 4 is
developing a curry product, right?

732
00:46:45,378 --> 00:46:49,215
But apparently, Team 1 is
also developing a curry product, right?

733
00:46:50,216 --> 00:46:52,760
How can you betray us like this?

734
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:54,512
Associate Director Gye,

735
00:46:54,595 --> 00:46:56,847
when did we betray--

736
00:46:56,931 --> 00:46:59,725
Stop. Everyone stop.

737
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:09,944
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 4
DEPARTMENT HEAD GYE BIN

738
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,987
Stop calling me "associate director."

739
00:47:12,071 --> 00:47:14,198
I became a department head ages ago.

740
00:47:16,242 --> 00:47:17,618
Sorry, old habits die hard.

741
00:47:18,244 --> 00:47:22,873
Anyway, what we're making is curry toast.

742
00:47:22,957 --> 00:47:25,084
It's a snack!

743
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:28,712
But the one that you're making
is some kind of curry… What was it?

744
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:29,672
Stew.

745
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:34,218
Right. Curry stew or whatever.

746
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:36,178
"Whatever"?

747
00:47:37,138 --> 00:47:38,889
Are you insulting our curry stew?

748
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,684
You ate it up
when I made it for you at home.

749
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:43,477
Apologize!

750
00:47:49,817 --> 00:47:50,651
Whatever.

751
00:47:51,527 --> 00:47:54,989
You must have come to pick a fight
because you're jealous of my team.

752
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,782
If you're going to keep doing this,

753
00:47:56,866 --> 00:47:58,951
then at least buy us some coffee,
all right?

754
00:47:59,034 --> 00:48:00,828
"Pick a fight"? "All right"?

755
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:06,584
Look at those rhymes.

756
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,295
What are you, a rapper?

757
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:16,552
Let me say it again.

758
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:20,222
Watch yourselves, Team 1!

759
00:48:20,306 --> 00:48:21,348
Stop it, Mr. Gye.

760
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:24,351
Sorry, we're going now.

761
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:25,686
Bye!

762
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,938
You should speak up more, Ms. Kim!

763
00:48:28,022 --> 00:48:30,483
You saw how that newbie
didn't even get up to greet us!

764
00:48:36,864 --> 00:48:40,034
Those two are scary when they fight.

765
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:42,244
What if they get a divorce?

766
00:48:42,328 --> 00:48:43,621
No way.

767
00:48:53,672 --> 00:48:54,507
Babe.

768
00:48:56,592 --> 00:49:00,721
I acted a bit tough
because my team was watching. Sorry.

769
00:49:02,056 --> 00:49:04,099
Let's go home together after work, okay?

770
00:49:04,183 --> 00:49:05,017
Promise?

771
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:08,687
Promise?

772
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,901
Watch out, Team 1.

773
00:49:16,445 --> 00:49:18,239
I'm going to make her curry stew again.

774
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:44,932
Hi, Young-seo.

775
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:48,435
Right now?

776
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:52,147
Jeez.

777
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:04,577
Sorry, Sung-hoon.

778
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:08,831
Here you go.

779
00:50:08,914 --> 00:50:09,790
Thanks.

780
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:13,877
The advertisers are coming in ten minutes,
but I left my edited copy at home.

781
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:16,547
I don't know where my head is these days.

782
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,758
I'm not working anyway.
Don't worry and order me around.

783
00:50:19,842 --> 00:50:23,178
It's so nice that my boyfriend
is taking the year off.

784
00:50:24,513 --> 00:50:26,140
I'll see you at home. Bye.

785
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:28,225
Young-seo.

786
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:29,852
Yes?

787
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:31,604
I love you.

788
00:50:32,605 --> 00:50:33,939
I love you too.

789
00:50:44,382 --> 00:50:45,717
Here is your fried chicken.

790
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,760
Thank you.

791
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,595
No problem. Enjoy.

792
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,347
<i>-Over 170 million dollars…</i>

<i>I like to believe</i>

799
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,989
our dedication to our customers
really got through to them

800
00:51:06,073 --> 00:51:07,574
to make all this magic happen.

801
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,245

802
00:51:11,328 --> 00:51:12,621

<i>even the worst clichés sound good

<i>Well, I'm flattered.</i>

807

<i>President Kang Tae-moo appeared
on a talk show this day and--</i>

808
00:51:25,006 --> 00:51:26,841
Why did you do that?

809
00:51:26,925 --> 00:51:29,010
They're talking about
the dumplings Ha-ri made.

810
00:51:29,094 --> 00:51:33,306
There's no reason to stare

He said that he'd be back soon

812
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:38,978
but he hasn't for a year, working at
the New York branch or whatever.

813
00:51:39,854 --> 00:51:42,107
He's probably just doing some work

814
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:44,609
since Chairman Kang
is still being treated there.

815
00:51:44,692 --> 00:51:45,568
Who knows?

816
00:51:45,652 --> 00:51:47,737
Maybe he has another girl.

817
00:51:47,821 --> 00:51:48,988
Don't be ridiculous.

818
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:54,953
I thought you hated him. Why are you
taking his side now? I don't get it.

819
00:52:14,013 --> 00:52:14,889
<i>Ha-ri.</i>

820
00:52:14,973 --> 00:52:16,558
Hi, Tae-moo.

821
00:52:16,641 --> 00:52:17,517
Did you sleep well?

822
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,061
<i>I worked late last night
so I didn't get much sleep.</i>

823
00:52:20,145 --> 00:52:22,564
Really? Did you wake up because of me?

824
00:52:22,647 --> 00:52:23,731
No, it's all right.

825
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:26,067
You're doing well, right?

826
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:28,611
Of course. I'm always doing well.

827
00:52:29,737 --> 00:52:30,780
How's your grandfather?

828
00:52:30,864 --> 00:52:33,867
He got his regular checkup yesterday,
and they said he's fine.

829
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,201
<i>That's a relief.</i>

830
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,038
<i>So, Tae-moo…</i>

831
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:41,916
-<i>About your work in the US--</i>
-One second, Ha-ri.

832
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,086
<i>I need to take this call. It's for work.
I'll call you later.</i>

833
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,129
Sure.

834
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:55,346
Hey, that was a bit rude
of Tae-moo, right?

835
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,682
I'm allowed to feel hurt
about that, right?

836
00:53:09,235 --> 00:53:11,070
-Wake up. You need to see this.
-What?

837
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,614
-Come on, get up.
-Why?

838
00:53:12,697 --> 00:53:14,365
Mr. Kang's caught in a scandal!

839
00:53:14,449 --> 00:53:16,910
-What?
-Come on, look at it.

840
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:22,624
ROMANCE SUSPECTED BETWEEN PRESIDENT
KANG TAE-MOO AND CELLIST BAEK YUN-SEO

841
00:53:22,707 --> 00:53:25,627
That's just a rumor, right?
Nothing bad happened between you two?

842
00:53:28,922 --> 00:53:30,340
Yes.

843
00:53:30,423 --> 00:53:32,300
Nothing seemed off
when you were calling him?

844
00:53:33,927 --> 00:53:37,555
When I called him yesterday,
he just seemed busy because of work.

845
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:40,058
Come to your senses.

846
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:42,852
There must be
a load of hot women around him.

847
00:53:44,145 --> 00:53:45,063
What are you saying?

848
00:53:47,232 --> 00:53:48,107
Ha-min.

849
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:50,026
Get out.

850
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:51,986
Get out!

851
00:53:52,695 --> 00:53:56,157
-Come on, get out!
-Come to your senses.

852
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:29,941
<i>The person you have called is unavailable.
Please leave your message…</i>

853
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,902
He's not going to
pick up my call in this situation?

854
00:54:36,489 --> 00:54:39,367
<i>Did you see the news articles
about that scandal?</i>

855
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:41,244
So you're really going to be like this?

856
00:54:54,882 --> 00:54:55,800
Yes, Ms. Yeo,

857
00:54:55,883 --> 00:54:58,261
I'm going to be on vacation
until next Wednesday.

858
00:54:58,344 --> 00:55:00,471
<i>Are you finally using your vacation days?</i>

859
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:01,806
<i>Why, though?</i>

860
00:55:01,889 --> 00:55:03,391
I'm going to New York.

861
00:55:11,399 --> 00:55:13,276
Sir, could you open the trunk?

862
00:55:31,878 --> 00:55:33,963
How are you here?

863
00:55:34,047 --> 00:55:36,424
I came here without telling you
to surprise you.

864
00:55:37,383 --> 00:55:38,343
Where are you going?

865
00:55:38,426 --> 00:55:40,136
Of course, I was going to the States…

866
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,139
Damn it!

867
00:55:43,222 --> 00:55:44,307
What's wrong with you?

868
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:45,350
What?

869
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:48,519
You mean the scandal?

870
00:55:48,603 --> 00:55:50,229
You knew about that?

871
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,191
You ignored my calls and messages
when you knew?

872
00:55:53,274 --> 00:55:55,485
Do you know how much I…

873
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:01,199
Sorry. I only found out
after I got on the plane.

874
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:06,621
The two of you aren't…

875
00:56:08,122 --> 00:56:09,207
It's nothing, right?

876
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:11,918
Of course not.

877
00:56:12,919 --> 00:56:15,713
She's dating some international student.

878
00:56:16,589 --> 00:56:19,717
Her family leaked fake news
because they're against the marriage.

879
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:27,684
Hug me.

880
00:56:36,943 --> 00:56:39,153
You're not going to shove me away
and hit me, right?

881
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,615
You still hit me.

882
00:56:49,414 --> 00:56:50,748
You look so pretty today.

883
00:56:53,001 --> 00:56:54,752
Do you want to walk with me for a bit?

884
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:03,428
Why did you come here by yourself?
What about your grandfather?

885
00:57:03,511 --> 00:57:05,555
He'll come back to Korea
sometime next week.

886
00:57:05,638 --> 00:57:07,682
I came back a bit earlier to see you.

887
00:57:08,307 --> 00:57:10,560
Did he approve of our relationship?

888
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,022
Well, that is…

889
00:57:14,981 --> 00:57:17,400
I don't know if I should tell you.

890
00:57:17,483 --> 00:57:19,152
Hey, stop teasing me!

891
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:21,362
Fine.

892
00:57:21,446 --> 00:57:22,530
I'll tell you.

893
00:57:24,323 --> 00:57:28,870
He told me not to come back home
until you took this.

894
00:57:29,454 --> 00:57:32,707
What's this?

895
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,716
Are you…

896
00:57:43,134 --> 00:57:44,886
proposing to me right now?

897
00:57:46,471 --> 00:57:48,389
You know I hate wasting my time, right?

898
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:50,808
I can't be apart from you any longer.

899
00:57:52,351 --> 00:57:53,978
So let's get married.

900
00:57:56,981 --> 00:57:59,067
We will see about that.

901
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:05,073
It'll be your loss
if you try to play hard to get.

902
00:58:05,698 --> 00:58:08,117
You know I'm good
at a lot of different things, right?

903
00:58:48,407 --> 00:58:49,534
That took a while.

904
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,370
I didn't say yes yet.

905
00:58:52,453 --> 00:58:54,330
You put the ring on. That means yes.

906
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:56,749
Hey, I told you we'll see about that.

907
00:58:58,251 --> 00:58:59,502
Tell me that you love me.

908
00:59:00,128 --> 00:59:01,003
What?

909
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:26,571
