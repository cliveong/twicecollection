1
00:00:00,064 --> 00:00:04,933
BUSINESS PROPOSAL

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,274
Wait.

3
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:07,942
What?

4
00:00:08,652 --> 00:00:09,736
What are you doing?

5
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:11,112
Let's go, Ms. Shin Ha-ri.

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,450
What did you just call me?

7
00:00:18,703 --> 00:00:19,704
I mean…

8
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:22,207
How did you…

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,625
I know

10
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:26,211
that you're Shin Ha-ri.

11
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:28,296
So let's just go

12
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:30,256
to the police station first.

13
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:35,053
<i>Shin Ha-ri, right?</i>

14
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,054
Yes.

15
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:37,514
When is she getting here?

16
00:00:37,597 --> 00:00:39,933
She said that she was almost here.

17
00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:41,267
Ha-ri!

18
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:44,479
I mean, Geum-hui.

19
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:51,736
Just come here.

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,115
What happened?

21
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:57,033
I don't know.

22
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:02,539
Can you confirm
the footage you're about to see

23
00:01:02,622 --> 00:01:03,707
is of yourselves?

24
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,292
<i>Still, isn't it pretty?</i>

25
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:08,461
<i>Yes, I guess so.</i>

26
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:10,380
Yes, that's us.

27
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:13,425
Unbelievable.

28
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:17,387
What?

29
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:21,307
Fortunately, there was
no more footage after this scene.

30
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:23,476
What a relief.

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,479
So? What's going to happen
to the bastard who took these videos?

32
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:27,689
He'll be arrested, right?

33
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:30,984
With something of this level,
he'll probably just be fined.

34
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,068
What?

35
00:01:32,152 --> 00:01:33,236
How could that be?

36
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,905
He clearly approached me
to take secret videos of me.

37
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:37,157
He's only getting fined?

38
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,825
It upsets us too.

39
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:42,412
-But that is what the law currently says.
-But, still…

40
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:46,791
How can he only get a fine?

41
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,501
There they go.

42
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:50,253
Right? It makes no sense.

43
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:53,465
That man who installed the hidden camera…

44
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,383
Get me his personal information.

45
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:57,010
But why, sir?

46
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:06,561
I realized
that I don't know much about you.

47
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:08,021
My grandfather could ask about it.

48
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:11,649
Come to think of it, even since then…

49
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,404
balance the nutrition perfectly,
and make it commercially successful!

50
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:18,531
Again.

51
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:19,866
Again!

52
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:23,036
So he was already aware
that I was Shin Geum-hui…

53
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,041
and invited me to the Founding
Anniversary Ceremony on purpose?

54
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:33,171
No way.

55
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:34,923
<i>You're</i>

56
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:36,341
fired.

57
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:39,886
I don't work for you.

58
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:41,971
Who are you to tell me that I'm fired?

59
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:44,641
I am the president.

60
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:47,435
I found out
that you're an employee at UKay.

61
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,104
And I'll be buying the company out.

62
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,483
On one condition.

63
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:56,319
They must fire Shin Jeong-u,
who illegally filmed two women.

64
00:02:56,986 --> 00:02:58,655
Wait, what?

65
00:02:58,738 --> 00:02:59,989
I saw that this isn't

66
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:02,408
the first time you've done this.

67
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,710
<i>What should I even say?</i>

68
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:16,339
<i>I'm also a victim of Shin Jeong-u.</i>

69
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:20,260
<i>He set up a hidden camera
and filmed me secretly.</i>

70
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:22,428
<i>I want him to pay for his crimes.</i>

71
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:28,476
There are a lot of victims
of your illegal filming.

72
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,437
I'll find every one of them
and file a lawsuit accordingly.

73
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,404
<i>On top of that, if your attempt
to destroy the evidence is added,</i>

74
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:42,490
you'll be serving time
in prison for a long time.

75
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:43,408
Wait.

76
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:45,743
How did you get…

77
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:49,289
You've managed to make it this far
without getting caught.

78
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:52,083
But unfortunately,

79
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:53,710
you ran into me.

80
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:57,297
And as you can see, I'm rich, persistent,

81
00:03:58,381 --> 00:03:59,382
and smart.

82
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:04,095
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:07,265
Please forgive me just once. Have mercy.

84
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:10,518
I still have a lot of years to live.

85
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:12,103
I can't go to prison.

86
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:13,146
You have no shame.

87
00:04:14,022 --> 00:04:17,984
Have you ever thought about your victims
who've been forced to live with the burden

88
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:20,153
of unknowingly being filmed?

89
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,786
After serving time, it'll be hard
for you to get a job anywhere.

90
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,539
Please have mercy. Please…

91
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:33,499
Hey!

92
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,171
Why are you doing all of this?
This has nothing to do with you!

93
00:04:44,844 --> 00:04:45,678
You…

94
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:49,557
messed with someone
you should've never messed with.

95
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:53,937
You piece of trash.

96
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:58,149
Hey, Young-seo. Did you get to work okay?

97
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,318
No, I'm not worried.

98
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,778
I know how strong you are.

99
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:06,157
Make sure to call me
if you don't want to be alone at night.

100
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,951
-Son of a bitch.
-Bastard.

101
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:09,202
I feel much better now.

102
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:11,663
Yes. You seem pretty angry too, Mr. Cha.

103
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:12,580
What?

104
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:14,540
I think you're a lot more upset, sir.

105
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:15,500
What?

106
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,004
Well, who wouldn't be upset
in a situation like this?

107
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,881
-Indeed.
-Yes.

108
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:23,716
Ms. Shin!

109
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,009
Hello.

110
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:26,678
-Did you just get here?
-Yes.

111
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:29,681
It's President Kang.

112
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:32,600
His face is like a company perk.

113
00:05:32,684 --> 00:05:35,186
I wonder who will end up
marrying a guy like that--

114
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:37,480
Ms. Shin?

115
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:38,564
Ms. Shin--

116
00:05:40,316 --> 00:05:41,943
Hello.

117
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:52,745
Hello. I mean, goodbye.

118
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:57,834
-Go up first.
-What?

119
00:05:58,376 --> 00:05:59,419
Good morning.

120
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:00,336
Hello.

121
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:05,133
Is Ms. Shin not here yet?

122
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:06,426
Yes, she's not here yet.

123
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:07,885
-What?
-Why?

124
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:11,347
I saw Ms. Shin on the first floor earlier.

125
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:12,765
Then why isn't she here yet?

126
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:14,934
I thought she'd be here already.

127
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:18,312
Right. I asked her
for some data yesterday.

128
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:27,655
Damn it.

129
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:51,471
I can't live like this.
It's so nerve-racking.

130
00:06:57,268 --> 00:07:00,271
<i>Don't we have things to talk about?
Let's meet after work.</i>

131
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:06,944
What? What about Ms. Shin?

132
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:10,615
Didn't you hear me?
I've developed feelings for Ms. Shin.

133
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:13,034
No wonder.

134
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,161
How did this happen?

135
00:07:15,244 --> 00:07:17,080
Not long ago, you were really angry…

136
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:22,210
and wanted to get back at her.
What's happened?

137
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:25,088
I think I've been attracted to her
ever since I first met her.

138
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:27,590
Seeing how I decided to marry her.

139
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:30,009
The woman you wanted to marry
was Shin Geum-hui.

140
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:32,845
How are they different?

141
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:33,888
Pardon?

142
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:37,433
Other than the fake backstory
and the lame disguise,

143
00:07:37,517 --> 00:07:38,810
she was the real Shin Ha-ri.

144
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:42,230
I also like
that she's a dedicated researcher.

145
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:45,316
So what are you going to do now?

146
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,234
What do you mean?

147
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:48,277
I'll tell her.

148
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:49,237
What?

149
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:57,578
What do you think?
Do you think she'll like it?

150
00:07:57,662 --> 00:07:59,705
Sir, aren't you taking things too fast?

151
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:02,166
To confess your feelings
without the proper buildup…

152
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,044
Who would possibly reject me
if I said I liked them?

153
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:06,963
I like how confident you are, but--

154
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:08,840
-I take this one.
-Yes, sir.

155
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:38,077
Ms. Shin, do you want
to start seeing each other

156
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:39,787
with marriage in mind?

157
00:08:40,872 --> 00:08:43,374
I told you, I'm good at a lot of things.

158
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:47,545
Will this do?

159
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:48,880
Yes.

160
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:52,425
I'll signal by putting my fingers
up to my forehead like this. Thank you.

161
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:53,342
Yes, sir.

162
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:14,113
President Kang.

163
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:17,033
Please, sit.

164
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,219
Let's eat first.

165
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:39,138
No, I don't want to eat.

166
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:50,483
I am sincerely sorry
for lying to you this whole time.

167
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:54,403
From the very beginning,
I didn't approach you deliberately.

168
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:57,240
If I had known
that you'd be my blind date,

169
00:09:57,323 --> 00:09:58,449
I never would have gone.

170
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:02,495
And after that,
I got tangled up in that contract--

171
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:04,038
It's fine.

172
00:10:04,747 --> 00:10:07,041
I didn't call you here
to hear you say that.

173
00:10:09,252 --> 00:10:10,795
Now, what I was going to say is…

174
00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:15,049
No. Hear me out first.

175
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,472
RESIGNATION LETTER

176
00:10:22,974 --> 00:10:23,975
A resignation letter?

177
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:29,063
Are you handing in your resignation?

178
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:33,568
All the things you did to me
since you found out that I'm Shin Geum-hui

179
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:35,611
was to fire me, right?

180
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:39,532
Fine. I understand that you're mad.

181
00:10:39,615 --> 00:10:43,661
But, even though I wronged you personally,

182
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:46,747
I did nothing wrong as an employee.

183
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:47,790
So…

184
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:50,876
please give me one more chance.

185
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:55,047
-A chance?
-Please listen to my presentation.

186
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:58,676
After that, you can decide if you want
to accept my resignation or not.

187
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,677
A presentation?

188
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:10,438
I have compiled all of the contributions
that I've made for the company.

189
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:12,565
You have two choices.

190
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:15,985
First, you could fire me,
a competent employee, for personal reasons

191
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,529
and then regret it for a long time.

192
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,114
Or, as a second option,

193
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:24,285
you could take advantage of my abilities
and have me work really hard

194
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:25,870
until the day I retire.

195
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,291
This isn't why I called you here.

196
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:33,127
What?

197
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:40,176
This is the <i>bindaetteok</i> that I came up
with right after I started working.

198
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:42,845
It was praised for its traditional taste.

199
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,557
And this is the Bucket List Sandwich,
which I also proposed.

200
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,059
Or the K-Pop Sandwich.

201
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:52,396
And this is the Bucket List Fish
that's top-ranked in the market.

202
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,732
It was also produced by me.

203
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:58,361
As you can see, I am an excellent employee
who helped produce so many products,

204
00:11:58,444 --> 00:12:01,614
and the youngest employee
to ever receive the Mega Hit Award.

205
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,034
Will you really cast me aside

206
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,661
because you want to get back at me?

207
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,270
What? A presentation?

208
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,109
Stop it.

209
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:40,569
So what did you tell her?

210
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:41,570
What do you think?

211
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:43,948
I said that I would think about it.

212
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:46,325
How can she

213
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:48,953
not see me in a romantic light?

214
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:51,956
I'm handsome, tall, and rich.
What do I not have?

215
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:52,998
There's one thing.

216
00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:58,337
That heart-pounding charm.

217
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:02,091
Ms. Shin's heart is currently beating
for another man.

218
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:06,637
She said that one-sided crush was over.

219
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,224
But it takes time to open up
your heart to somebody else.

220
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:13,310
Besides, the setup of the relationship
between you and Ms. Shin

221
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,271
is basically the worst.

222
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:16,897
What? How--

223
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:22,069
Because, to Ms. Shin, you're simply
a terrifying boss who tried to fire her.

224
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:23,821
I don't think it was that bad.

225
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:27,908
I mean, we did have some romantic moments.

226
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:30,870
That was when you were
on fake dates during a fake relationship.

227
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:36,250
From now on,
you need to make real situations.

228
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,544
Real situations?

229
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:49,764
Why isn't he reaching out to me?

230
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:52,641
Damn it.

231
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:56,103
Should I have begged him to not fire me?

232
00:13:58,731 --> 00:14:00,107
President Kang?

233
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:03,486
INCOMING CALL
YOO-RA

234
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,863
Why is she calling me all of a sudden?

235
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:07,531
Congratulations.

236
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:09,825
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

237
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:11,035
Congratulations.

238
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,293
LIMITED TIME SPECIAL OFFER
GET A NEW PHONE NOW

239
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:21,921
Going on television
and having a product released.

240
00:14:22,004 --> 00:14:23,380
One meal will never cut it.

241
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:26,467
Yeong-jun, why are you
making a big deal out of it?

242
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,761
This is all thanks to Ha-ri
who recommended him.

243
00:14:28,844 --> 00:14:30,513
He should be treating her, if anybody.

244
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:33,599
No, it's all because Min-woo
did everything so well.

245
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:36,227
I do owe you. You got me this TV spot

246
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,897
to make me more recognizable
since I'm the least popular chef.

247
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:44,985
Still, like Ha-ri said, you wouldn't
have made it if you weren't good.

248
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:46,779
Anyway, thank you, Ha-ri.

249
00:14:49,114 --> 00:14:51,200
I'll go get some more snacks.

250
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,953
I'm going to get another bottle of wine.

251
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,416
Those two are impressive.

252
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,585
How many times have they broken up?

253
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,005
I don't get Yoo-ra, who wanted to
get back together after breaking up,

254
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:06,882
or Min-woo, who accepted her back.

255
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:07,842
Stop it.

256
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:11,470
Honestly, I thought that
Min-woo would end up dating Ha-ri.

257
00:15:11,554 --> 00:15:13,889
Me too. Weren't you two a thing?

258
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:15,474
What?

259
00:15:15,558 --> 00:15:16,684
No!

260
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:19,520
"A thing"?
Stop saying stupid things like that.

261
00:15:19,603 --> 00:15:22,481
Watch your mouth, okay?

262
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,068
What are you guys talking about?

263
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:28,279
Nothing, we didn't talk about much.

264
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:31,824
By the way,
are you two doing anything this weekend?

265
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:34,118
-Do you want to go on a trip together?
-A trip?

266
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:38,956
Oh, Min-woo's TV program
is filming in Busan.

267
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,667
Da-hye, Ji-min and I
are going to go with him.

268
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:45,296
I'm really sorry,
but I'm busy this weekend.

269
00:15:45,838 --> 00:15:47,590
You have something too, right?

270
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:49,842
-What? Me?
-Yes.

271
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,219
Oh, yes, right.

272
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:55,264
By the way, Ha-ri,
you've been staring at your phone.

273
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,892
-Did you get a boyfriend?
-What?

274
00:15:57,975 --> 00:16:00,394
Of course, Ha-ri doesn't have a boyfriend.

275
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:03,772
Ha-ri, your standards are too high.
Maybe you should lower them.

276
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:04,773
-Right.
-Guys!

277
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:08,986
Ha-ri does have a boyfriend.

278
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,654
-Really?
-What?

279
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:12,239
What are you doing? Sit down.

280
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:17,286
He's super handsome,
really nice to Ha-ri, very tall,

281
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,206
and he comes from a really rich family.

282
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:24,835
You're going on a date
with him this weekend too, right?

283
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,253
-I did?
-Yes.

284
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:28,964
Hey, Min-woo.

285
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:32,259
They say Ha-ri has a boyfriend.
Did you know?

286
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:37,348
Are you dating the guy
that you went to the concert with?

287
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:38,974
What?

288
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:40,851
Yes.

289
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:43,270
-You went to a concert together?
-What? With who?

290
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:45,105
Really? Hey, show us a picture!

291
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:46,857
Let's see a picture.

292
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:48,067
Later.

293
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,321
Yes, guys, later.
He's better-looking in person.

294
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:55,324
Do you guys not believe me?

295
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:58,327
I can't believe you.
Why would you lie like that back there?

296
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,162
I was just annoyed by Yoo-ra.

297
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:04,667
Where's the guy that I'm seeing
who's very tall, handsome, and rich?

298
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,960
I want to see him too.

299
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:07,670
You know who I'm talking about.

300
00:17:07,753 --> 00:17:10,089
-Kang Tae-moo. Although it's fake.
-What?

301
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:13,133
I'm just saying, I wish you would
just date Kang Tae-moo

302
00:17:13,217 --> 00:17:15,052
and crush Yoo-ra, that's all.

303
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,221
What are you talking about?

304
00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:21,266
I'm about to get fired by Kang Tae-moo.

305
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:26,855
Don't worry. Even if you get fired,
I'll beg my father to help you get a job.

306
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,817
Did I drink too much wine?
My stomach hurts.

307
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,443
I'm going to the bathroom.

308
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:32,528
It hurts.

309
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:40,369
Jeez.

310
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:55,592
I'm just going to go once I'm back home.

311
00:17:57,553 --> 00:17:58,929
Damn it.

312
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,015
<i>Come see me in my office.</i>

313
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:30,919
Did you not sleep well?

314
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:31,879
What?

315
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:35,424
Yes, I guess.

316
00:18:35,507 --> 00:18:37,551
You were so confident before,

317
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:40,345
but I guess you were worried
you'd get fired.

318
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:45,267
I'll be fine with whatever decision
you've made, sir.

319
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,773
That's a good stance.

320
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,445
RESIGNATION LETTER

321
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,796
Like you said, it would be my loss
to fire a useful employee like you

322
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:15,214
because of a personal reason.

323
00:19:16,632 --> 00:19:19,426
Thank you, thank you so much!

324
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,263
I will work as hard as I can. Thank you!

325
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:24,389
See you after work.

326
00:19:24,473 --> 00:19:27,935
I've been working on a project
for a new product in secret.

327
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:29,228
After work?

328
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:31,772
Is that a problem?

329
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:35,275
What happened to that employee
who just told me she would work

330
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:36,860
as hard as she can?

331
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:39,029
No. She's right here.

332
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:41,698
Then I'll see you later. Thank you, sir.

333
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,723
Why does he want to see me after work?

334
00:20:08,183 --> 00:20:10,602
Well, that doesn't matter.

335
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,229
I didn't get fired!

336
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:20,863
This one's better, right?

337
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,657
Okay, so we're done with this product.

338
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,701
Let's start on the next product
after a break.

339
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:27,870
-Okay.
-I'm going to the bathroom real quick.

340
00:20:27,953 --> 00:20:29,079
Sure.

341
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:31,957
By the way,
don't you hate the bathroom here?

342
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,751
Right? It's a unisex bathroom.
It makes me uncomfortable.

343
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:38,005
<i>I shouldn't drink this
if I don't want to go to the bathroom.</i>

344
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:43,594
Hi, babies!

345
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:46,388
Everyone, please have some coffee.

346
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:49,224
This is from a super expensive
and famous shop.

347
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:02,446
Oh, my god!

348
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:04,990
Hello, how are you?

349
00:21:09,244 --> 00:21:11,288
Oh, my god!

350
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:16,919
Yes, that sounds great.

351
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:20,422
Oh, my god!

352
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:29,139
Oh, my god!

353
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:30,515
Oh, my god!

354
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:37,522
Oh, my god!

355
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:44,238
Ms. Jin. I can't believe it.

356
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:47,199
Why do you keep getting
the same clothes as me?

357
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:50,202
I think you're the one
who's doing that actually.

358
00:21:50,285 --> 00:21:52,454
Stupid! That makes no sense.

359
00:21:52,537 --> 00:21:56,041
I'm sure that the employee said
that this was the last one.

360
00:21:56,124 --> 00:21:58,585
-Is that really what they said?
-Yes.

361
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:00,087
Oh, my.

362
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:04,216
When I went to buy it, the employee
said that there were just two pieces left.

363
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:08,971
So I bought it before you, right?

364
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:22,818
What kind of new product is it that
you wanted to see me at a movie theater?

365
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:25,153
I don't have a detailed plan yet,

366
00:22:25,237 --> 00:22:27,239
so I asked to see you here
to clear my head.

367
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:30,242
Then shouldn't we discuss
the new product first?

368
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:33,495
Do you think I asked to see you
at a theater just to clear my head?

369
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:37,207
The main character in this movie
is a researcher at a food company.

370
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,293
I'm preparing to localize
our products in the US,

371
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:42,713
so won't it be helpful
to see what researchers do

372
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:43,964
in the United States?

373
00:22:46,842 --> 00:22:49,011
I see. So you're saying that

374
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:52,514
since I can't go abroad in person,

375
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:56,226
it would be helpful to indirectly
experience it through a movie, right?

376
00:22:57,019 --> 00:22:57,936
That's right.

377
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,772
Sure, I think it'll be helpful.

378
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:05,027
I only saw places like these on TV shows.

379
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:07,779
What do you want to eat?

380
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:15,370
They all look good.

381
00:23:15,454 --> 00:23:16,830
Then let's order all of them.

382
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:24,880
By the way, there's nobody here.

383
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:27,049
Of course. I rented the entire place.

384
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:30,010
What? The entire place? Why?

385
00:23:30,093 --> 00:23:33,180
I've always hated crowded places.

386
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:35,766
Unbelievable.

387
00:23:42,481 --> 00:23:43,356
Want a glass of wine?

388
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:49,863
My chair isn't working.

389
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:54,117
Let me see.

390
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,050
Wait.

391
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:12,094
I'm going to the bathroom.

392
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:21,812
Gosh, my heart skips a beat
at the smallest things.

393
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:28,360
You haven't dated in a long time.
Shin Ha-ri.

394
00:24:32,197 --> 00:24:33,115
Far too long.

395
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:35,492
Sure.

396
00:24:36,368 --> 00:24:37,327
Ms. Shin?

397
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,747
What are you two doing here?

398
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:44,376
What do you mean? We're here
to watch a movie at the movie theater.

399
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:48,171
Mr. Gye kept telling me that
he had a VIP ticket or something.

400
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:52,384
-I see.
-Turns out that ticket was for today.

401
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:54,386
It would've been a waste to throw it away.

402
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:57,973
but the easiest person
who I could think of calling was Ms. Yeo.

403
00:24:58,056 --> 00:25:00,267
So I let her come with me. Yes.

404
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,518
That's what happened.

405
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:02,978
Okay.

406
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:03,895
"The easiest"?

407
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:06,314
I came here because you begged me.
Should I just go?

408
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:09,151
Hey, don't be like that.
You're already here.

409
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:12,487
Are you here by yourself?

410
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:15,907
Yes.

411
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:19,202
It's not like
I have a boyfriend or anything.

412
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:21,872
Movies are best watched alone, right?

413
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,583
I'll go to watch the movie, then.

414
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:27,169
I'll see you at work tomorrow. Bye.

415
00:25:29,546 --> 00:25:30,755
Shall we go in too?

416
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:36,094
President Kang.

417
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:46,479
Did she go over there?

418
00:25:46,563 --> 00:25:49,941
That's the pricey theater.
Why would she go over there alone?

419
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:51,276
Did she go over here?

420
00:25:51,902 --> 00:25:53,737
President Kang. We have a big problem.

421
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,780
-What?
-We have to be careful when we leave.

422
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:59,201
-I just met Ms. Yeo and--
-Ms. Shin?

423
00:26:02,037 --> 00:26:02,996
Why, Ms. Yeo?

424
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:08,835
Why are you here?

425
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:09,753
Gosh.

426
00:26:13,048 --> 00:26:14,090
Look at this.

427
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,348
This place is awesome.

428
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:22,641
Right?

429
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:25,143
Are you waiting for somebody?

430
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,728
No.

431
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:30,982
I booked two seats so I could watch
the movie comfortably by myself.

432
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:34,361
Flex, right.

433
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:39,532
Flexing like this sometimes
is really good for de-stressing.

434
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,461
Gosh, this is--

435
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:54,005
I think the movie
is supposed to start soon.

436
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:55,298
You two should go.

437
00:26:56,675 --> 00:26:58,885
This is so much food for just one person!

438
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,097
How about we join you?

439
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,473
No! That's not--

440
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:04,808
-Let's go.
-It's starting.

441
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:05,976
I, that's, no--

442
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,727
Come on, where's your conscience?

443
00:27:07,811 --> 00:27:09,312
You can go watch it by yourself.

444
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:10,313
Darn it.

445
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:15,026
-It's starting.
-Right.

446
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:19,948
-It reclines.
-Really?

447
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:23,827
The popcorn's delicious.

448
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:49,227
Thank you for your hard work.

449
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:59,237
I've been out on business all day,
so I couldn't go to the bathroom.

450
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,699
What am I doing?

451
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,952
I really need to go.

452
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,705
When is the bus coming?

453
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,085
Save me, God.

454
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:25,972
What?

455
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,143
Thank you for helping me catch the guy
who had secretly filmed me.

456
00:28:30,226 --> 00:28:32,354
I didn't even get to thank you properly.

457
00:28:32,437 --> 00:28:33,271
It's fine.

458
00:28:33,897 --> 00:28:35,523
I did what anybody would have done.

459
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:42,697
Are you all right?

460
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:44,115
What?

461
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:48,119
Of course. It wasn't a big deal.

462
00:28:57,504 --> 00:28:59,339
It should be over by now.

463
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,895
They said that it will awaken
the desire to be in a relationship.

464
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:16,106
What a lie. Don't you think so?

465
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:20,402
-Are you crying?
-But the female lead died.

466
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:25,699
And she even had the same name
as my younger sister who passed away.

467
00:29:27,575 --> 00:29:28,576
Sujeong.

468
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:33,790
Mr. Gye must have
a younger sister who died.

469
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:37,419
Younger sister, my foot.
He used to have a dog named Sujeong.

470
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:39,546
Poor Sujeong.

471
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:43,258
I didn't even get to be with her
when she passed.

472
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,343
I'm so sorry!

473
00:29:45,427 --> 00:29:49,222
If a dog lived to be 20 years old
and even had a great-grandson,

474
00:29:49,305 --> 00:29:50,932
it had a much better life than you.

475
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:52,308
Who's pitying who now?

476
00:29:54,144 --> 00:29:55,645
Why haven't they parted ways yet?

477
00:30:00,942 --> 00:30:02,235
Unbelievable.

478
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:08,408
Yes, sir.

479
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:11,077
Is the movie over?

480
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:16,499
Yes. But Mr. Gye wanted to
have a drink, so I'm on my way there.

481
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:17,834
<i>Did you go back home?</i>

482
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:20,420
Of course.

483
00:30:20,962 --> 00:30:24,007
Did you think that I'd be waiting for you?

484
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,341
Here? With nothing to do?

485
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:27,927
What are you doing, Ms. Shin? Let's go.

486
00:30:28,803 --> 00:30:29,721
Coming.

487
00:30:30,388 --> 00:30:34,225
I'll let you know about the report
once I've submitted it. Bye.

488
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:43,276
A report?

489
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:46,905
The traffic's pretty bad.

490
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:53,328
-Are you hot?
-What?

491
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:55,663
Yes, a bit.

492
00:30:56,706 --> 00:30:58,208
Could I open the window?

493
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,250
Sure.

494
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,677
<i>You need to hold it in, Young-seo.</i>

495
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:12,722
<i>Think about something
other than the bathroom.</i>

496
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:16,351
<i>Today is Monday, right?
So tomorrow starts with a T, toilet day--</i>

497
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:18,061
<i>What? No.</i>

498
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:19,437
<i>Think about something else.</i>

499
00:31:20,939 --> 00:31:22,148
Excuse me.

500
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:25,318
Could you turn on some music?

501
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:26,653
Music?

502
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:31,616
<i>This is my delight</i>

503
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:34,702
<i>Thus to wait and watch at the wayside</i>

504
00:31:36,204 --> 00:31:37,372
<i>Where shadow chases light</i>

505
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:39,833
<i>And the rain comes
In the wake of the summer</i>

506
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:41,251
I'm getting off here!

507
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:43,336
What? Here?

508
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:44,295
Yes.

509
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:46,256
I think I need to get off.

510
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:48,633
Why would you get off
in the middle of the road--

511
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:50,969
What I'm saying is…

512
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:53,513
Are you all right?

513
00:31:55,306 --> 00:31:57,016
If I stay in here any longer…

514
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:02,021
I'll probably relieve myself in the car.

515
00:32:02,772 --> 00:32:03,898
What?

516
00:32:03,982 --> 00:32:06,317
Goodbye, then.

517
00:32:09,612 --> 00:32:11,155
Wait. Ms. Jin!

518
00:32:18,913 --> 00:32:20,415
Bathroom.

519
00:32:20,957 --> 00:32:23,626
Jin Young-seo, hold it.
You can hold it. You can do it.

520
00:32:25,336 --> 00:32:28,381
I'm going to die of embarrassment.

521
00:32:29,924 --> 00:32:31,718
Bathroom!

522
00:32:31,801 --> 00:32:34,053
Now I'm feeling a number two too.

523
00:32:34,804 --> 00:32:36,472
I'm going crazy!

524
00:32:39,976 --> 00:32:40,810
What?

525
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:43,521
Dear God, dear Buddha.

526
00:32:43,605 --> 00:32:45,607
What have I done that was so horrible?

527
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:50,737
Why did you chase me all the way here?

528
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,406
I was worried.
Why haven't you gone inside yet?

529
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:54,449
The door is locked.

530
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:58,036
Go away, quick.
I really could do it right here.

531
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,454
Hold on.

532
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:09,297
What?

533
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,382
-Get in. Quickly.
-Wait, slowly.

534
00:33:15,887 --> 00:33:17,347
Mr. Cha, you should go first!

535
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:54,133
Why is it so hard to go on just one date?

536
00:34:00,264 --> 00:34:02,350
What excuse should I use
to call her next time?

537
00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:15,154
SHIN HA-RI

538
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:17,407
Why are there so many people
with the same name?

539
00:34:25,623 --> 00:34:28,626
The plan for the second half
of this year is the following.

540
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,715
Expand the size of our online platform
to 300 percent of what it is currently.

541
00:34:33,798 --> 00:34:37,844
We expect the profits of this to be
about 80 billion won.

542
00:34:37,927 --> 00:34:40,805
After discussing this through a meeting
with the consulting firm…

543
00:34:40,888 --> 00:34:42,432
She was cute when she was young too.

544
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:44,058
Our online platform is not easy to use

545
00:34:44,142 --> 00:34:47,395
when compared to the rest of the market
and other companies' systems.

546
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:50,565
Also, according to our customers,

547
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:53,234
we don't have
detailed descriptions of our products

548
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:55,862
and many other inconvenient aspects.

549
00:34:55,945 --> 00:34:57,864
This is an area we need to fix.

550
00:34:57,947 --> 00:35:00,908
Ms. Shin. We're going on
a business trip together.

551
00:35:01,576 --> 00:35:02,535
Be prepared.

552
00:35:08,529 --> 00:35:09,905
GANGWONDO

553
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:12,199
One, two, three.

554
00:35:13,075 --> 00:35:14,451
Congratulations.

555
00:35:14,535 --> 00:35:16,787
Congratulations, sir.

556
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:20,082
Lastly, this is the grand ballroom.

557
00:35:20,165 --> 00:35:21,959
Gosh, it looks incredible.

558
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:25,963
Chairman Kang, thank you for coming
and staying with me until the end.

559
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:27,423
No problem.

560
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:30,467
You probably have a lot of guests.
I should let you go.

561
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:33,345
-I hope you have a pleasant time, then.
-Yes, thank you.

562
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:34,513
Let's go.

563
00:35:38,976 --> 00:35:40,352
-Sung-hoon.
-Yes, sir.

564
00:35:40,436 --> 00:35:42,855
-Do I have anything else for today?
-No, sir.

565
00:35:42,938 --> 00:35:46,400
It's been a while
since we've come all the way to Sokcho.

566
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:48,485
Let's go fishing by the ocean.

567
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:51,488
Go fishing with Sung-hoon.
I have another engagement today.

568
00:35:51,572 --> 00:35:52,531
What?

569
00:35:53,032 --> 00:35:54,450
Why do you always--

570
00:35:57,369 --> 00:35:58,203
Really?

571
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:01,832
Okay, then take care of your business,

572
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:03,834
and I'll see you in Seoul, okay?

573
00:36:05,002 --> 00:36:07,379
Just stay the night over, okay?

574
00:36:07,463 --> 00:36:08,756
Come back tomorrow.

575
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:10,549
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

576
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:11,508
All right, then.

577
00:36:11,592 --> 00:36:12,593
Yes.

578
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:15,262
I'll see you in Seoul, sir.

579
00:36:16,847 --> 00:36:18,641
Hey, Sung-hoon. Come over here.

580
00:36:19,642 --> 00:36:20,517
Hey.

581
00:36:21,352 --> 00:36:27,107
Tae-moo's "engagement" is
taking Ms. Shin Geum-hui on a date, right?

582
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:30,486
-What?
-Tell him to go on a lot of dates.

583
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:35,866
It would be even better
if they come back with a great-grandson.

584
00:36:37,743 --> 00:36:40,496
Hey, let's go. Let's go fishing.

585
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:41,580
Come on, let's go.

586
00:36:43,582 --> 00:36:46,335
When he finds out that Shin Geum-hui
is actually Shin Ha-ri--

587
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:54,927
I can't believe that
I'm going on a business trip…

588
00:36:56,428 --> 00:36:57,888
on my precious weekend.

589
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,349
I brought this on myself.

590
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,893
Ha-ri, you idiot.

591
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,938
<i>We're on our way.</i>

592
00:37:06,021 --> 00:37:08,691
<i>Ha-ri and Young-seo,
I wish that you guys could come, too.</i>

593
00:37:09,316 --> 00:37:12,528
<i>Ha-ri said she has a date with
her boyfriend.</i>

594
00:37:12,611 --> 00:37:14,113
<i>Have fun on your date.</i>

595
00:37:14,196 --> 00:37:17,199
<i>Thanks. Have fun on your trip.</i>

596
00:37:22,162 --> 00:37:25,916
Yes, sir. I just got here. Where are you?

597
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,167
I see you.

598
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:28,585
You can see me?

599
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:48,105
Gosh. He looks so cool.

600
00:37:52,151 --> 00:37:55,029
You're here for work.
Come to your senses, Ha-ri.

601
00:38:02,578 --> 00:38:04,538
Why did you ask me to come to Sokcho?

602
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:08,917
Did you get an idea for that new product?

603
00:38:10,794 --> 00:38:12,713
Sokcho has a lot of good dishes,

604
00:38:12,796 --> 00:38:15,215
so I thought
that I might get an idea as I'm eating.

605
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:18,761
I actually did a lot of research
on the famous restaurants in Sokcho.

606
00:38:21,638 --> 00:38:24,016
Let's go to the one that I found first.

607
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:25,476
Sure.

608
00:38:26,226 --> 00:38:27,978
Give me your bag and wait in the car.

609
00:38:28,062 --> 00:38:29,396
No. It's all right.

610
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:42,367
Also, according to our customers,

611
00:38:42,451 --> 00:38:45,746
we don't have
detailed descriptions of our products

612
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:47,623
and many other inconvenient aspects.

613
00:38:47,706 --> 00:38:49,416
This is an area we need to fix.

614
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,459
I WANT TO VISIT SOKCHO
AND HAVE DELICIOUS FOOD

615
00:38:59,218 --> 00:39:00,594
What are you doing?

616
00:39:00,677 --> 00:39:02,638
I can drive.

617
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:07,017
-But I should drive--
-No. I can't let you drive, sir.

618
00:39:07,101 --> 00:39:09,228
I'm a great driver. Don't worry.

619
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:10,187
Let's go!

620
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:27,371
Where shall I take you, Mr. Kang?

621
00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:32,501
SOKCHO <i>MAKGUKSU</i>

622
00:39:32,584 --> 00:39:34,419
<i>Looking for the route</i>

623
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:36,171
-I really wanted to go here.
-<i>…with the least travel time.</i>

624
00:39:36,255 --> 00:39:37,714
-Is that so?
-Yes.

625
00:39:37,798 --> 00:39:40,926
Then why don't we take our time
and go on a drive along the sea?

626
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:42,511
Go on a drive?

627
00:39:42,594 --> 00:39:44,680
We don't have the time for that, sir.

628
00:39:44,763 --> 00:39:46,140
-Seatbelt.
-What?

629
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:47,975
Put on your seatbelt tightly. Quick.

630
00:39:48,058 --> 00:39:50,477
All right. Let's go.

631
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:51,562
Wait.

632
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:08,745
-Thank you!
-Yes, thank you.

633
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:11,707
LUNCH SERVICE OVER
OUT OF INGREDIENTS

634
00:40:14,418 --> 00:40:15,252
Sir!

635
00:40:16,044 --> 00:40:17,504
Two people.

636
00:40:17,588 --> 00:40:18,422
You can't?

637
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:20,424
60 YEARS OF TRADITION
SOKCHO <i>MAKGUKSU</i>

638
00:40:20,507 --> 00:40:22,759
We should have come a bit faster.

639
00:40:22,843 --> 00:40:25,137
Then let's wait and come back for dinner.

640
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,471
No, that won't do.

641
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:28,765
Then our meal plans get all messed up.

642
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:30,475
Are we here to only eat food?

643
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:34,229
Yes. We're here to eat food
so we can come up with a new product.

644
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,856
That's true.

645
00:40:37,107 --> 00:40:40,861
Fortunately, the grilled fish restaurant
takes reservations, so I made one.

646
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:43,030
But it's a bit far from here.

647
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,907
I'll look it up on the map.

648
00:40:57,294 --> 00:40:58,128
Hello?

649
00:40:58,212 --> 00:41:00,339
<i>Hello, I've arrived at the beach.</i>

650
00:41:01,173 --> 00:41:02,382
You're there already?

651
00:41:02,466 --> 00:41:04,176
That's good. We'll be on our way.

652
00:41:12,226 --> 00:41:14,269
-Hey--
-The grilled fish restaurant

653
00:41:14,353 --> 00:41:16,355
is about 40 minutes from here.

654
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:17,439
Is that okay?

655
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:20,525
It's not okay. Let's just eat
something simple nearby.

656
00:41:21,151 --> 00:41:21,985
Nearby?

657
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:24,821
But there aren't
any good restaurants nearby.

658
00:41:24,905 --> 00:41:26,698
Maybe there's something near the beach.

659
00:41:26,782 --> 00:41:27,950
Near the beach?

660
00:41:30,202 --> 00:41:33,288
Sir, I think all of the restaurants
are over there.

661
00:41:33,372 --> 00:41:35,249
I wanted to see the ocean while I'm here.

662
00:41:35,332 --> 00:41:38,377
We couldn't
because our schedule was so busy.

663
00:41:39,086 --> 00:41:40,087
I see.

664
00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:46,802
What?

665
00:41:46,885 --> 00:41:47,970
THE HAMBURGER THAT WILL BECOME
THE SPECIALTY OF GANGWONDO

666
00:41:53,433 --> 00:41:54,768
I know that truck.

667
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:58,313
That truck goes to Sokcho and Yangyang
based on the owner's whim.

668
00:41:58,397 --> 00:42:00,774
So people say it's hard to eat there.

669
00:42:00,857 --> 00:42:01,775
Is that so?

670
00:42:02,401 --> 00:42:04,194
We must be lucky to have come across it.

671
00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:05,612
Right?

672
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:11,743
Hello!

673
00:42:11,827 --> 00:42:14,162
Hello. There you are.

674
00:42:17,457 --> 00:42:21,295
Why did you come to sell burgers here?
This place is so remote.

675
00:42:21,378 --> 00:42:24,256
Well, I had a feeling that

676
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:27,551
a handsome couple like you
would be right here, waiting for me.

677
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:28,593
So here I am.

678
00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:32,472
We're not a couple.

679
00:42:32,556 --> 00:42:33,807
What's the best one here?

680
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,976
They're all delicious.
You can choose here.

681
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:37,227
Just take a look.

682
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:39,438
It looks so good.

683
00:42:39,521 --> 00:42:41,857
I want the egg… Just a second.

684
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:43,358
Grilled…

685
00:42:43,442 --> 00:42:45,986
They're all good, right?
Which one should I get?

686
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:56,288
Here is our special gourmet burger
and blueberry ade.

687
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,124
Thank you.

688
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,543
I thought it was a prank call at first.

689
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:03,837
You said if I sold you
just two hamburgers,

690
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,881
you'd pay me an entire day's profit.

691
00:43:08,508 --> 00:43:09,926
I wanted to do a special event.

692
00:43:11,303 --> 00:43:15,182
She would be very touched
if you told her that you called me here.

693
00:43:16,391 --> 00:43:17,434
It'd be tasteless

694
00:43:18,226 --> 00:43:19,311
if I bragged about it.

695
00:43:26,568 --> 00:43:28,320
Is the hamburger ready?

696
00:43:29,321 --> 00:43:31,406
-Thank you.
-No, not at all.

697
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:36,161
Please have a wonderful
and meaningful day.

698
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:37,829
Thank you.

699
00:43:37,913 --> 00:43:39,456
Shall we eat over there?

700
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:40,582
Sure.

701
00:43:47,881 --> 00:43:48,882
Is it good?

702
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:51,343
Yes. I've fulfilled my wish.

703
00:43:53,387 --> 00:43:55,639
I didn't know that
you liked hamburgers so much.

704
00:43:57,057 --> 00:43:59,434
I didn't get to eat it a lot
when I was a kid.

705
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,144
Why not?

706
00:44:02,187 --> 00:44:05,190
My family ran a bakery
when I was in elementary school.

707
00:44:06,024 --> 00:44:08,318
My parents wouldn't buy me any hamburgers,

708
00:44:08,402 --> 00:44:11,279
because people wouldn't buy our bread
if they saw me eat them.

709
00:44:11,863 --> 00:44:15,117
So I went through a hard time trying
to eat them in secret.

710
00:44:18,453 --> 00:44:19,538
I'm sorry.

711
00:44:19,621 --> 00:44:22,415
I shared too much information.
You probably aren't interested.

712
00:44:22,499 --> 00:44:23,333
No.

713
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:25,794
I'm very interested in you, Ms. Shin.

714
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,004
What?

715
00:44:29,381 --> 00:44:32,217
It's my duty as the president
to be interested in my employees.

716
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:33,635
I see.

717
00:44:36,012 --> 00:44:38,223
I saw that you majored
in Food and Culinary Arts.

718
00:44:38,932 --> 00:44:40,892
When did you want to become a researcher?

719
00:44:43,478 --> 00:44:44,604
When I was young

720
00:44:45,355 --> 00:44:46,690
I didn't really have a dream.

721
00:44:47,774 --> 00:44:49,484
Since I liked food so much,

722
00:44:49,568 --> 00:44:52,445
I thought I should major in culinary arts
and become a chef.

723
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:56,491
Then I found out in college that there was
a job called a "Food Product Researcher."

724
00:44:56,575 --> 00:44:59,161
So, as you can see, here I am.

725
00:45:00,078 --> 00:45:02,581
So do you have a dream now?

726
00:45:04,249 --> 00:45:05,083
Yes.

727
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:06,626
What is it?

728
00:45:09,796 --> 00:45:13,592
It's a bit embarrassing.
Do I really have to say it here?

729
00:45:13,675 --> 00:45:16,636
I'm asking you as your boss.
You should answer me as my employee.

730
00:45:17,596 --> 00:45:19,306
What is this, a job interview?

731
00:45:22,392 --> 00:45:23,393
Fine.

732
00:45:26,396 --> 00:45:30,734
I always bought my food when I was young
because my parents were so busy.

733
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:36,781
So the frozen food made by big companies
was my favorite childhood food.

734
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,286
I want to let other people feel
the same happiness that I felt

735
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:44,331
when I ate that frozen food in the past.

736
00:45:45,123 --> 00:45:49,211
Not everyone can afford to eat
at Michelin restaurants every day.

737
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:54,758
You said that you were developing
a kimchi product for the overseas market

738
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:57,219
and that you made several different
versions of it.

739
00:45:57,302 --> 00:45:59,930
I really identified with you
as a researcher.

740
00:46:00,013 --> 00:46:00,972
Is that so?

741
00:46:02,349 --> 00:46:05,101
You must have thought
I didn't do any work.

742
00:46:05,185 --> 00:46:07,854
No. That's not what I meant.

743
00:46:10,607 --> 00:46:13,360
Damn. I really dug my own grave
with that one.

744
00:46:14,986 --> 00:46:16,613
A lot of things happened that day,

745
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,115
but is that the only thing you remember?

746
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:20,492
No.

747
00:46:21,326 --> 00:46:24,037
I went to a luxury brand shop

748
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,957
and such an expensive restaurant
for the first time in my life.

749
00:46:27,874 --> 00:46:30,377
I could never forget. How could I?

750
00:46:36,925 --> 00:46:38,343
It was like this that day too.

751
00:46:48,436 --> 00:46:50,522
Whether you're Geum-hui or Ha-ri,

752
00:46:52,691 --> 00:46:53,900
I guess this is the same.

753
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:07,539
It's so hard trying
to avoid him all the time.

754
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:11,376
It's not like I can move somewhere else.

755
00:47:12,669 --> 00:47:13,628
Welcome.

756
00:47:13,712 --> 00:47:16,381
Do you mind sitting over here?
That table is reserved.

757
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:25,140
Let's go home. I'm done eating.

758
00:47:25,223 --> 00:47:28,601
Here's your seafood <i>jjamppong</i>. Enjoy.

759
00:47:29,894 --> 00:47:32,897
Please eat. If I'm making you
uncomfortable, I'll leave.

760
00:47:33,648 --> 00:47:36,901
No, take a seat. There's no need for that.

761
00:47:36,985 --> 00:47:39,612
<i>Right, it's not like
I committed a crime or anything.</i>

762
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:52,959
Okay!

763
00:47:53,752 --> 00:47:55,003
-All right!
-Wait, no.

764
00:47:55,086 --> 00:47:58,840
I'll drive from now on.
You can ride in the passenger's seat.

765
00:47:58,923 --> 00:48:01,259
No. I feel better if I'm driving.

766
00:48:01,343 --> 00:48:04,346
But I don't like it.
Just rest in the passenger's seat.

767
00:48:05,638 --> 00:48:08,099
Still, how can I let my boss drive--

768
00:48:08,183 --> 00:48:11,478
When you were Shin Geum-hui,
you gladly sat in the passenger's seat.

769
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:14,272
Wasn't I your boss back then too?

770
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:17,400
Well, that's true, but…

771
00:48:17,484 --> 00:48:18,610
Then just get in.

772
00:48:19,611 --> 00:48:20,737
Okay.

773
00:48:28,411 --> 00:48:29,537
Welcome.

774
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:34,793
This is going down smoothly.

775
00:48:38,671 --> 00:48:39,631
What?

776
00:48:40,382 --> 00:48:42,258
Why isn't it coming out?

777
00:48:43,593 --> 00:48:46,846
Excuse me, one soju and one beer, please.

778
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,515
Sure thing. One moment.

779
00:49:11,204 --> 00:49:14,124
I have a question.
Why are you avoiding me?

780
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:18,545
I have a question too.

781
00:49:18,628 --> 00:49:22,757
Do you really not know the answer,
or are you acting like this on purpose?

782
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:24,092
Of course I don't know it.

783
00:49:24,175 --> 00:49:25,135
I'm avoiding you

784
00:49:25,844 --> 00:49:27,345
because I'm embarrassed.

785
00:49:29,222 --> 00:49:30,181
I made such a scene

786
00:49:31,141 --> 00:49:32,475
in front of a man I…

787
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,854
What kind of woman wouldn't avoid him?

788
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:38,064
Wait.

789
00:49:38,898 --> 00:49:41,443
Why are you embarrassed by that?
It's a natural thing.

790
00:49:42,569 --> 00:49:44,154
Oh, my gosh!

791
00:49:44,654 --> 00:49:47,532
So stop avoiding me from now on, okay?

792
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:56,124
Yes, Mr. Kim.
Why are you calling on the weekend?

793
00:50:09,137 --> 00:50:10,638
Where did the woman go?

794
00:50:11,347 --> 00:50:12,599
She just left.

795
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:16,227
Jin Young-seo, you can't cross the line!

796
00:50:16,311 --> 00:50:18,313
Don't cross the line! Snap out of it!

797
00:50:18,396 --> 00:50:20,273
Come to your senses.

798
00:50:21,524 --> 00:50:23,443
Why is he riding a scooter
on the sidewalk?

799
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:27,030
Are you hurt anywhere?

800
00:50:27,697 --> 00:50:28,907
What?

801
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:30,283
Why are you here?

802
00:50:30,366 --> 00:50:32,035
I followed you because I was worried.

803
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:36,331
Haven't you been rejecting me
this whole time?

804
00:50:36,414 --> 00:50:38,833
Why are you being so nice to me?

805
00:50:40,627 --> 00:50:41,836
If I'm being honest,

806
00:50:42,754 --> 00:50:47,509
I fell for you the minute I laid eyes
on you at the convenience store.

807
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:51,012
But you were President Kang's secretary,

808
00:50:51,638 --> 00:50:56,392
and you drew a line
and told me not to cross it.

809
00:50:57,018 --> 00:50:59,938
And I can't even go to the bathroom
without being scared

810
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:01,231
because of that creep.

811
00:51:01,856 --> 00:51:04,734
Not to mention making a fool of myself
in front of you.

812
00:51:05,485 --> 00:51:06,486
Fine!

813
00:51:07,028 --> 00:51:08,571
This is for the better.

814
00:51:09,322 --> 00:51:11,407
I said I was going to stop liking you--

815
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,080
I told you to stop being nice to me.

816
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:20,750
Let go of me.

817
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:22,126
You'll fall if I let go.

818
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:27,090
Why do you care if I fall or not?

819
00:51:28,633 --> 00:51:30,593
I'm going to count to three, so let go.

820
00:51:31,636 --> 00:51:33,179
If you don't, I'm really…

821
00:51:35,098 --> 00:51:36,891
going to cross the line.

822
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:40,687
One.

823
00:51:42,897 --> 00:51:43,731
Two.

824
00:51:46,734 --> 00:51:47,610
Three.

825
00:52:15,612 --> 00:52:18,072
I think I had too many
hamburger and dumplings.

826
00:52:18,156 --> 00:52:19,824
I'm still so full.

827
00:52:19,908 --> 00:52:22,452
Thankfully, your clothes
didn't burst at the seams today.

828
00:52:22,535 --> 00:52:25,663
No, those clothes were
too small back then.

829
00:52:27,832 --> 00:52:29,918
I'm sorry. Those were expensive clothes.

830
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:33,129
I want to stop hearing apologies
from you, Ms. Shin.

831
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:34,631
What?

832
00:52:34,714 --> 00:52:37,383
There are a lot of nice things to say
other than apologies.

833
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:40,261
Like how I'm cool,
or that it's fun to be with me.

834
00:52:45,517 --> 00:52:47,185
You're funny.

835
00:52:49,229 --> 00:52:51,272
Aren't you tired?
Get some sleep if you are.

836
00:52:51,356 --> 00:52:54,025
I'm fine. You must be
even more tired since you're driving.

837
00:53:01,324 --> 00:53:02,367
What?

838
00:53:02,951 --> 00:53:04,577
It's raining.

839
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:06,371
Darn it, this is out of the blue.

840
00:53:06,996 --> 00:53:09,415
I didn't think about the rain.

841
00:53:09,999 --> 00:53:13,253
I didn't bring an umbrella.

842
00:53:15,922 --> 00:53:18,341
<i>Mom, Dad!</i>

843
00:53:20,093 --> 00:53:21,844
<i>Dad!</i>

844
00:53:34,148 --> 00:53:34,983
Get out.

845
00:53:35,733 --> 00:53:36,568
What?

846
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,322
I forgot that
I have an important meeting here today.

847
00:53:41,906 --> 00:53:43,366
Go back to Seoul on your own.

848
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:48,121
Still, how could I go from here to--

849
00:53:48,204 --> 00:53:49,831
Didn't you hear me?

850
00:53:53,918 --> 00:53:54,752
Okay.

851
00:54:09,684 --> 00:54:11,019
My bag!

852
00:54:11,102 --> 00:54:13,021
President Kang, my bag!

853
00:54:13,605 --> 00:54:14,856
My bag!

854
00:54:14,939 --> 00:54:15,982
Darn it.

855
00:54:24,198 --> 00:54:25,617
What in the world?

856
00:54:26,367 --> 00:54:27,577
It's pouring.

857
00:54:38,171 --> 00:54:39,714
What the hell is this?

858
00:54:46,804 --> 00:54:48,973
<i>Mom, Dad!</i>

859
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:51,309
Dad!

860
00:54:51,392 --> 00:54:53,603
-<i>Don't look!</i>
-<i>Mom!</i>

861
00:54:53,686 --> 00:54:55,563
Dad!

862
00:54:55,647 --> 00:54:56,731
Don't look.

863
00:54:56,814 --> 00:54:58,608
<i>Mom!</i>

864
00:55:00,276 --> 00:55:02,320
-<i>Mom!</i>
-My God, Tae-moo!

865
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:03,863
<i>Dad!</i>

866
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:19,003
How could he just leave me
on the side of the road when it's raining?

867
00:55:19,712 --> 00:55:21,631
What an awful boss!

868
00:55:28,179 --> 00:55:31,015
Don't die on me!

869
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:32,016
Darn it.

870
00:55:38,022 --> 00:55:39,148
Damn it.

871
00:55:44,862 --> 00:55:47,198
My heart fluttered
when he tied my shoelaces for me.

872
00:55:49,951 --> 00:55:51,202
I must have been insane.

873
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:58,459
What's wrong with this thing?

874
00:56:52,388 --> 00:56:58,186
<i>The number you dialed is not available.
Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

875
00:56:58,269 --> 00:56:59,437
Where did she go?

876
00:57:03,066 --> 00:57:05,860
Was this all part of his grand plan
to get his revenge on me?

877
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,114
Probably not.

878
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,533
I don't think he has the time for that.

879
00:57:15,536 --> 00:57:19,373
Then why did he just abandon me
on the side of the road when it's raining.

880
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:21,375
<i>I don't like rainy days.</i>

881
00:57:22,168 --> 00:57:23,795
<i>Let's change the date instead.</i>

882
00:57:29,258 --> 00:57:31,803
I left a phone here a while ago
so it could be charged.

883
00:57:32,637 --> 00:57:33,805
Over there.

884
00:57:33,888 --> 00:57:34,764
Here you go.

885
00:57:34,847 --> 00:57:35,723
Thank you.

886
00:57:37,016 --> 00:57:38,101
Ha-ri!

887
00:57:40,561 --> 00:57:41,395
What?

888
00:57:41,979 --> 00:57:43,314
What are you guys doing here?

889
00:57:43,981 --> 00:57:45,399
Weren't you going to Busan?

890
00:57:45,483 --> 00:57:48,444
Min-woo's filming here instead.
Didn't you see my text?

891
00:57:49,445 --> 00:57:50,530
What? No.

892
00:57:50,613 --> 00:57:54,325
You also said that you have a date today.
Are you here with your boyfriend?

893
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:56,452
Well, that's--

894
00:57:56,536 --> 00:57:58,871
Hey, no need to play shy between friends.

895
00:57:58,955 --> 00:58:01,666
Since we've met like this,
let us see your rich boyfriend.

896
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:03,584
Yes, let us meet him, Ha-ri.

897
00:58:03,668 --> 00:58:05,253
-Let us see him!
-Let us see him!

898
00:58:05,837 --> 00:58:08,881
Actually, I didn't come
with my boyfriend--

899
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:09,799
Babe.

900
00:58:26,149 --> 00:58:27,024
Did you wait long?

901
00:58:33,072 --> 00:58:34,073
Ha-ri.

902
00:58:35,283 --> 00:58:36,117
Who is this?

903
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,118
Oh, he's--

904
00:58:37,201 --> 00:58:38,536
Nice to meet you.

905
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:41,038
I'm Ha-ri's boyfriend, Kang Tae-moo.

906
00:59:21,078 --> 00:59:22,914
If we want to take your friends' ego
down a notch.

907
00:59:22,997 --> 00:59:25,917
Do you know what my love for you
and this credit card have in common?

908
00:59:26,626 --> 00:59:27,710
<i>They both have no limit.</i>

909
00:59:28,711 --> 00:59:31,005
You're seriously out of your mind!

910
00:59:31,088 --> 00:59:32,256
How did you two start dating?

911
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:35,134
I've never met anyone as crazy as Ha-ri.
It was refreshing.

912
00:59:35,218 --> 00:59:37,637
<i>Do you really not know
why I spent the entire weekend</i>

913
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,639
pretending to be your boyfriend
when I hate wasting my time

914
00:59:39,722 --> 00:59:41,182
<i>more than anything?</i>
