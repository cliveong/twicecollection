EPISODE 7

3
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:19,452
Where did she go?

4
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:23,623
ARCHAEOPTERYX

5
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:25,876
Why don't you pick it up?
It could be important.

6
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:32,090
Hello? Ms. Shin!

7
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:33,258
Hello?

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,805
Isn't this Shin Ha-ri's phone?

9
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:39,848
Who is this?

10
00:00:41,516 --> 00:00:43,602
You also said that you have a date today.

11
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:45,729
Are you here with your boyfriend?

12
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,939
Well, that's--

13
00:00:48,523 --> 00:00:50,525
Hey, no need to play shy between friends.

14
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:53,278
Since we've met like this,
let us see your rich boyfriend.

15
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:55,447
Yes, let us meet him, Ha-ri.

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,032
-Let us see him!
-Let us see him!

17
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:59,034
Actually, I didn't come
with my boyfriend--

18
00:00:59,117 --> 00:00:59,993
Babe.

<i>A BUSINESS PROPOSAL</i>

20
00:01:20,138 --> 00:01:21,389
Did you wait long?

21
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,271
Ha-ri.

22
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:31,232
-Who is this?
-Oh, he's--

23
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,945
Nice to meet you.
I'm Ha-ri's boyfriend, Kang Tae-moo.

24
00:01:38,657 --> 00:01:39,783
Hello.

25
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:43,662
Hello.

26
00:01:44,245 --> 00:01:47,624
Ha-ri, since we're all here,
we should all have dinner together.

27
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,627
-Are you okay with that?
-Shall we?

28
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:52,337
It's okay, right, babe?

29
00:01:57,258 --> 00:01:58,259
Right this way.

30
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:03,098
What are you doing?

31
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:05,100
Why are you pretending to be my boyfriend?

32
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:06,851
Shouldn't you thank me first?

33
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:11,606
I just saved you from your friends
finding out about your lie.

34
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:14,192
Shouldn't you

35
00:02:14,943 --> 00:02:16,194
apologize first?

36
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:20,073
You left me on some road in the rain
because of some meeting.

37
00:02:25,286 --> 00:02:26,246
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,958
That's why I came here
after canceling my meeting.

39
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:34,504
Really?
I guess I was worried for nothing, then.

40
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,631
What do you mean?

41
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:38,466
Never mind. It's not important.

42
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,760
Then let's go in.
Your friends must be waiting.

43
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,054
What? Go in where?

44
00:02:43,138 --> 00:02:45,390
I need to finish
what I've started, don't I?

45
00:02:45,473 --> 00:02:46,599
It's fine.

46
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,226
Don't make this any bigger. Just--

47
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:51,396
My God. Ha-ri really has a boyfriend.

48
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,731
Right?

49
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:56,985
It seemed suspicious,
so I thought it was a lie.

50
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:58,903
Anyway, the guy is…

51
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,114
so good-looking.

52
00:03:02,073 --> 00:03:03,158
Right?

53
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:04,743
He looks like a model.

54
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:07,162
He's decked out in designer clothing…

55
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:09,164
He's amazing.

56
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:14,961
Hey, you don't think Ha-ri is the one
who buys him all those expensive clothes,

57
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,338
right?

58
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:20,675
Please. Do you think
Ha-ri has the money for that?

59
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:23,428
Do you think you telling them the truth

60
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,722
is the best option here?

61
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:28,475
Just accept my help

62
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:31,269
and keep your pride, at least.

63
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:34,522
Let's see.

64
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:36,733
If we want to take your friends' ego
down a notch.

65
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,985
what should my concept be?

66
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:45,325
Dinner is on me today.

67
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:47,243
-So please, eat all you want.
-Thank you.

68
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,703
-Thank you.
-It's so expensive.

69
00:03:48,787 --> 00:03:49,621
Babe.

70
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:54,292
Don't look at that. Look only at me.

71
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:57,087
Do you know what my love for you

72
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,714
and this credit card have in common?

73
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,426
They both have no limit.

74
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,222
There's no limit at all.

75
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:12,435
SHOW OFF YOUR WEALTH

76
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,853
That's so cool.

77
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:33,081
Stop staring at me, please eat--

78
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:35,291
Just eat.

79
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,962
I'm full from just watching you eat, babe.

80
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:45,260
You're so clumsy.

81
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:49,889
It's okay. I can do it.

82
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,268
You're just too pretty.

83
00:04:57,188 --> 00:04:59,482
I'm going to the bathroom real quick.

84
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,278
Shall we go?

85
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:05,864
No. I can go by myself.

86
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:09,284
I get nervous
when you're out of my sight, babe.

87
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:11,411
I'll just walk with you over there.

88
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:18,334
ACT CLINGY

89
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,645
Be careful!

90
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:39,856
-Are you all right?
-What?

91
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,649
-You're not hurt?
-I'm fine.

92
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:42,901
Look at that guy.

93
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:45,194
He's perfect
and it looks like he loves Ha-ri.

94
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,323
Yes, I'm so jealous.

95
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:49,449
Hey, you!

96
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:52,160
What would you have done
if you hurt my girlfriend?

97
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:57,582
BE LOYAL LIKE A DOG

98
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:01,419
What is it about Ha-ri
that you like so much?

99
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,379
She's pretty.

100
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,968
I've never seen anyone as pretty
as Ha-ri in my entire life.

101
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:13,890
Stop exaggerating just
because you're in front of my friends.

102
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,642
I'm not exaggerating.

103
00:06:17,894 --> 00:06:19,604
I knew it when I first saw her.

104
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:21,606
That she was the girl for me.

105
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:25,109
<i>What? How many women has he dated</i>

106
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:28,196
<i>for these comments to come so easily?</i>

107
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,991
I'm so jealous, Ha-ri!
Your boyfriend is such a sweetheart.

108
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:34,535
Hey, Min-woo is no chump either.

109
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,413
If Min-woo was here too,
being all sweet to you…

110
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:40,583
It's creeping me out
just thinking about it.

111
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,628
Min-woo? Do you mean Chef Lee Min-woo?

112
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:45,713
Do you know Min-woo?

113
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:47,840
I've met him for work, at the office.

114
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,843
You work at the same company as Ha-ri?

115
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:53,596
-Which department do you work in?
-Well, he--

116
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,514
Well…

117
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:57,016
What department
does the president belong to?

118
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:00,561
-Are you okay, Ha-ri?
-Ha-ri!

119
00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:02,647
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

120
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:04,148
The president?

121
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,901
-The president?
-I didn't mishear that, right?

122
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:12,448
I'm so full.

123
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:17,287
Thank you for the meal, President Kang.

124
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,540
Don't call your friend's boyfriend
"President Kang." It's so formal.

125
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,876
We really enjoyed the meal.

126
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,587
Oh, right. Where are you two staying?

127
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:27,964
Today, we're--

128
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,382
We're also staying here.

129
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,428
Really?

130
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:34,554
Great.

131
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:38,057
Then let us buy you guys lunch tomorrow.
Since you bought dinner today.

132
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,852
-Yes, let's do that.
-I'll see you tomorrow.

133
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:43,438
-See you tomorrow.
-Have a good night!

134
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,235
What are you doing?
We need to go back to Seoul.

135
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,862
There's no bus now.

136
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:53,072
And we can't drive since we drank.

137
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:58,077
Right.

138
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,387
-What are you doing there?
-What?

139
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:24,354
This wallpaper is so pretty.
I wonder where it's from.

140
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,442
If you want more to drink,
care to have some wine with me?

141
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:30,943
A drink?

142
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:34,155
No, I'm fine.
I don't want to drink anymore.

143
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:35,406
All right, then.

144
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:51,047
Sir.

145
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,759
Can we get separate rooms?

146
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,305
How can the two of us share a room?

147
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:02,058
Does it make sense
for a couple to sleep in separate rooms?

148
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,478
How will you explain that
to your friends if they find out?

149
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,814
I mean,

150
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:09,857
that's true, but…

151
00:09:09,941 --> 00:09:11,901
I won't bite you, so don't worry.

152
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,320
You can take the bed.
I'll sleep on the couch.

153
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:17,240
No. I'm more than fine on the couch.

154
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,284
How can I let you sleep on the couch?

155
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:21,702
Here we go.

156
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,875
Sleep here if you want.

157
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:31,462
I'll move you to the bed
once you're asleep.

158
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:34,465
Is that…

159
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,385
what you're hoping for?

160
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:44,976
No. Right, I should sleep
in the bed, right?

161
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,310
Yes, thank you.

162
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:50,982
She's so adorable.

163
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,198
This will leave a stain.

164
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,617
I can't go to bed like this.

165
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:14,130
Maybe this is even weirder.

166
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,633
But…

167
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,886
I can't just sleep

168
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:21,679
in this bathrobe.

169
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:26,976
What do I do? This whole situation
is weird to begin with.

170
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:31,272
Why is she dating such a perfect guy?
How annoying.

171
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,443
Everything Ha-ri does gets on my nerves.

172
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:48,331
You're done shooting already?
You're back early.

173
00:10:48,956 --> 00:10:51,042
Yes. By the way, what's with the suite?

174
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,920
Ha-ri's boyfriend upgraded our room.

175
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:55,713
Ha-ri's boyfriend?

176
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:58,507
Yes. We ran into them
so we ate dinner together.

177
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:04,055
Did you not know who her boyfriend was?

178
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:06,057
No.

179
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:07,767
Who is he?

180
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:10,603
Don't be surprised.

181
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:15,358
It's Kang Tae-moo,
the president of go food.

182
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,317
What?

183
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:18,236
President Kang?

184
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,126
<i>How did you meet Mr. Kang, anyway?</i>

185
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,838
<i>Yes. How did a lowly employee
get to date the president?</i>

186
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:39,257
I can't believe them.

187
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,299
Is something wrong?

188
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,636
No, it's nothing.

189
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:45,846
<i>Why aren't you replying?</i>

190
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,099
<i>Are things getting steamy
between you two already?</i>

191
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:50,142
Who's texting you at this hour?

192
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:51,686
Are you in a fling with some guy?

193
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:55,189
No. It's my friends from before.

194
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:58,359
Do they think I'm not your real boyfriend?

195
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:01,320
They don't suspect a thing.

196
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:03,072
They're totally into it.

197
00:12:03,781 --> 00:12:05,658
They all want to know how we met.

198
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,535
Well…

199
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:10,037
my acting was perfect, after all.

200
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:17,169
What should I tell them?

201
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:19,005
What's there to worry about?

202
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:21,299
Just tell them I fell in love with you

203
00:12:21,382 --> 00:12:23,092
-at first sight.
-What?

204
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,304
If it's too cheesy for you,
do you want me to type it out for you?

205
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:31,267
No. I can type it myself.

206
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:37,356
But what should I do?

207
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:40,401
About what?

208
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:43,863
I'm not worried about my friends
because you won't have to see them again,

209
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:48,534
but you'll keep running into Min-woo
because of work.

210
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:51,245
I just don't want to put you
in an uncomfortable position.

211
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:57,084
Are you worried about me
being in an awkward position?

212
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,588
Or are you worried
because of your crush on him?

213
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:04,175
What?

214
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:07,011
How did you--

215
00:13:07,094 --> 00:13:08,763
Did you think I was that clueless?

216
00:13:09,638 --> 00:13:10,514
Yes.

217
00:13:11,182 --> 00:13:12,308
You really are clueless.

218
00:13:13,768 --> 00:13:17,897
Clueless enough to bring up
a one-sided crush from the past again.

219
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,526
Are you sure it's over?

220
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,987
I don't need a girlfriend
who cheats on me.

221
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:29,283
Well…

222
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,829
I noticed back there
that you're an amazing actor.

223
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,539
You should have been an actor.

224
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:38,250
I've told you before.
I'm good at many things.

225
00:13:42,963 --> 00:13:47,009
Well, then, would you like
to finish what you were doing?

226
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,303
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

227
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,180
I'm so tired.

228
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,104
Good night.

229
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,533
I'm not getting any sleep tonight.

230
00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:28,384
I'm definitely not getting any sleep.

231
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,501
<i>Hello?</i>

232
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:03,836
Are you still asleep?

233
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:05,546
It's time to get up.

234
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,149
Where are you?

235
00:15:25,232 --> 00:15:28,944
I'm working out. I didn't wake you up
because you were sleeping.

236
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:33,991
I couldn't sleep all night and ended up
nodding off early in the morning.

237
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:34,950
Yes.

238
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:37,036
<i>Somebody will be up there soon.</i>

239
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,329
Open the door for them.

240
00:15:38,412 --> 00:15:39,830
Who's coming up?

241
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:46,170
Hello, I was sent by President Kang.

242
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:48,130
He said you needed a change of clothes.

243
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,215
What?

244
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,762
<i>It'd be a bit strange to wear
the same clothes two days in a row.</i>

245
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:59,058
<i>Pick out what you like.
Preferably something white.</i>

246
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:00,601
<i>So we can wear matching clothes.</i>

247
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,062
Do we really have to?

248
00:16:33,384 --> 00:16:34,552
What?

249
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,262
What?

250
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,681
What?

251
00:16:48,816 --> 00:16:50,150
What is this?

252
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,821
This is Sung-hoon's apartment!

253
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,827
I picked these
because they suit me the best.

254
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,037
They won't think
we matched our outfits, right?

255
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,958
Hey, Min-woo!

256
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,628
I thought you couldn't make it.

257
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:11,630
Last night. The shoot was canceled.

258
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:13,883
Really?

259
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,092
I heard.

260
00:17:15,843 --> 00:17:18,429
You're dating President Kang?

261
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:21,724
Well…

262
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:22,725
yes.

263
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,310
I was surprised to hear about it.

264
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,437
I never would have imagined.

265
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:28,063
I'm sure.

266
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,816
<i>I never imagined
it would ever happen either.</i>

267
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,404
Ha-ri.

268
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,117
Ha-ri.

269
00:17:44,788 --> 00:17:45,789
Are you up?

270
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,876
You made it, Chef Lee.

271
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:56,091
He knows about us.
There's no need to be shy.

272
00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:58,052
Right?

273
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:04,224
I'm hungry. Let's go get breakfast.

274
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,983
What on earth happened?

275
00:18:19,823 --> 00:18:20,866
Right.

276
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,743
Then after that…

277
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:41,303
You're seriously out of your mind!

278
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,642
My coat and my phone…

279
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:53,691
-Are you all right, Young-seo?
-Yes.

280
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,609
I'm fine.

281
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:00,239
I got us some hangover soup.

282
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,825
No, I'm fine.

283
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:05,411
I need to get to work.

284
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:08,372
You're going to work on a Sunday?

285
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,084
Right…

286
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,838
I'm really busy at work these days.

287
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:19,133
Hey.

288
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:21,510
About yesterday…

289
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:26,515
Are we--

290
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,684
Yes, about yesterday.

291
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,103
Let's pretend it never happened.

292
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,733
What do you mean it never happened?

293
00:19:35,816 --> 00:19:36,942
Well…

294
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:38,902
I mean just pretend it never happened.

295
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,655
It's null and void.

296
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:45,075
Now, if you'll excuse me.

297
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:57,129
Null and void?

298
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:02,676
Is it because I'm so tense?
I can't digest anything.

299
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:06,847
I just want to go home and rest.

300
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:13,395
Yes. I will contact them right away.

301
00:20:14,855 --> 00:20:17,483
I have to go back to Seoul right away
because of a meeting.

302
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:18,692
All right, then.

303
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:20,527
Are you leaving already?

304
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:23,280
Yes. He's really busy.

305
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:26,158
Don't be like that. Hang out here
for at least another day.

306
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:29,161
Right. We're going to tour
the area nearby after breakfast.

307
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:30,996
Stop it. He says he's busy.

308
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,414
Hari, you should stay.

309
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,376
There's no need for you to leave too.

310
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:39,046
Isn't that right?

311
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:41,757
That's true.

312
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,593
Then I'll adjust my schedule
to fit Ha-ri's.

313
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:49,306
Babe. Do you want
to stay here for one more day?

314
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:50,224
Excuse me?

315
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,434
What?

316
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,576
This is amazing.
Who did you borrow it from?

317
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,036
It's my grandfather's.

318
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,579
He likes sea fishing.

319
00:21:12,663 --> 00:21:15,374
Wealthy people really are
on a different level.

320
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,292
I'm jealous, Ha-ri.

321
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,466
<i>Why is he going this far?</i>

322
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,301
<i>This is driving me insane!</i>

323
00:21:29,596 --> 00:21:30,639
Let's go.

324
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,393
Shall we?

325
00:21:41,191 --> 00:21:42,401
Take my hand, Ha-ri.

326
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,992
<i>This is crazy.</i>

327
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,703
<i>Why is your heart fluttering
right now? Come on, Ha-ri.</i>

328
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,664
It's okay. I can get up by myself.

329
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,333
Thank you.

330
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:14,600
Want some?

331
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:16,059
You should have some, too.

332
00:22:16,143 --> 00:22:17,811
I'm all right.

333
00:22:18,478 --> 00:22:19,521
Cheers!

334
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:23,066
It looks like it'll be hard
to see any dolphins today.

335
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,444
I know it's your wish to see a dolphin.

336
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:26,820
What a shame.

337
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:28,530
How did you know that?

338
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:31,283
You told me before.

339
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,243
Don't you remember?

340
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:34,870
I did?

341
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,372
Everyone knows
how much you love dolphins, Ha-ri.

342
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:38,999
It's all over your social media.

343
00:22:39,082 --> 00:22:41,376
Wouldn't it be weirder
for your boyfriend not to know?

344
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:44,046
I guess so?

345
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,505
Right.

346
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:49,801
How did you two start dating?

347
00:22:51,094 --> 00:22:53,847
It's not common for a president
to date his employee.

348
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:57,684
That's true. Now that I think about it,
I'm really curious.

349
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:00,062
Well…

350
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,898
I followed her around
because I fell for her at first sight.

351
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:08,695
<i>Love at first sight?
You probably thought I was crazy.</i>

352
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:10,697
I've never met anyone as crazy as Ha-ri.

353
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:11,865
It was refreshing.

354
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:15,327
Every time we met,
she would do something weird

355
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,079
and say the craziest things.

356
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:20,374
Remember what you said?

357
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:23,961
<i>Two-timing?</i>

358
00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:25,796
I've never done that in my life.

359
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:29,132
Though I have seen three
or four guys at the same time.

360
00:23:29,216 --> 00:23:32,678
Later, I found out that she was
only trying to push me away

361
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:35,806
because she realized
I was interested in her.

362
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:37,391
No way.

363
00:23:37,474 --> 00:23:39,601
What didn't you like about him?

364
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:44,481
When we met for the second time,

365
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,566
I proposed to her.

366
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:50,112
But she turned it down immediately.

367
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,948
So I had no choice
but to go on blind dates with other women.

368
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:58,537
But the more I did that,
the more I thought of her.

369
00:24:00,414 --> 00:24:02,541
So I asked her to see me again.

370
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:07,337
<i>How is he so good at making lies
sound like the truth?</i>

371
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:10,966
So stop asking me to get married to you
so early in our relationship.

372
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:14,970
Okay.

373
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:18,140
She hasn't dated many guys,
yet she's so good at playing hard to get.

374
00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:20,559
She always keeps me on my toes.

375
00:24:26,023 --> 00:24:27,774
You really cut right to the chase.

376
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,530
-You think so? Do you want to?
-Come on.

377
00:24:33,613 --> 00:24:36,199
-Okay. I'm going to the bathroom.
-Okay.

378
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:38,618
Chef Lee.

379
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:41,038
I heard you shot an SBC TV show yesterday.

380
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:44,583
Yes. I'm getting contacted a lot lately.
Thanks to the recent collaboration.

381
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:48,045
The marketing team was confident
that you would have the best reception.

382
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:51,381
I guess my Ha-ri really does
have a good eye.

383
00:24:53,717 --> 00:24:54,801
President Kang.

384
00:24:56,219 --> 00:24:57,054
Yes.

385
00:24:59,473 --> 00:25:00,766
May I ask you something?

386
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,393
Go ahead.

387
00:25:03,477 --> 00:25:05,729
Why did it have to be Ha-ri,
of all people?

388
00:25:05,812 --> 00:25:06,730
Of all people?

389
00:25:07,898 --> 00:25:09,316
What's that supposed to mean?

390
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:11,359
I won't beat around the bush.

391
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,780
To put it bluntly, you can date
any woman you want, right?

392
00:25:15,906 --> 00:25:17,407
But you're seeing Ha-ri,

393
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:20,327
who's not only from a normal family
but also your employee.

394
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,870
I just don't understand it.

395
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,121
So you're saying,

396
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:26,917
"Ms. Shin isn't good enough
to be dating someone like me."

397
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,001
Is that what you mean?

398
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:30,754
-I'm just worried about Ha-ri.
-I guess you only date

399
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,799
people who are on your "level"?

400
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:37,803
In my eyes,

401
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,348
Ms. Shin is someone with endless charm.

402
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,518
So don't you dare judge my girlfriend

403
00:25:45,894 --> 00:25:47,354
ever again.

404
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:50,649
Is that clear?

405
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:03,787
Gosh, this weather!

406
00:26:06,206 --> 00:26:07,916
I saw a fishing rod in the back.

407
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,501
Can we do some fishing?

408
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:11,461
Yes. I think it'll be fun.

409
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:12,587
A fishing rod?

410
00:26:14,214 --> 00:26:15,966
That's my grandfather's.

411
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:18,760
It reminds me of when I went fishing
on a boat with Min-woo.

412
00:26:19,553 --> 00:26:23,306
Min-woo made sashimi out of the red
sea breams we caught, right on the spot.

413
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,642
It was really fun, wasn't it?

414
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:28,395
Yes. That was some of the best
sashimi I've ever had.

415
00:26:29,062 --> 00:26:31,148
-It was so good.
-There's a spot

416
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:34,151
famous for having a lot of red sea breams.
Do you want to fish?

417
00:26:34,234 --> 00:26:38,029
We can catch some sea breams
and make sashimi. How about it, babe?

418
00:26:38,572 --> 00:26:40,198
You want to go fishing?

419
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:42,909
Yes, why not? Sure.

420
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:02,179
Okay.

421
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:15,108
What are you doing here?
Come stand next to me.

422
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,569
Mr. Kang. Right now, I'm actually--

423
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:20,405
-Hey, Min-woo already caught one!
-That's amazing!

424
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:24,201
I guess that's one to zero.

425
00:27:24,284 --> 00:27:27,329
Damn it. He started already?

426
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:30,582
-Mr. Kang. I--
-Wait! Let's talk later.

427
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:45,180
I got one!

428
00:27:46,056 --> 00:27:47,432
Okay, come on.

429
00:27:47,515 --> 00:27:48,808
There!

430
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:50,268
Now it's one-to-one.

431
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,732
Min-woo got another one.

432
00:27:55,815 --> 00:27:56,942
He got another one!

433
00:27:58,068 --> 00:27:58,944
He got one more.

434
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,947
Two-to-one.

435
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:03,865
Damn it.

436
00:28:11,414 --> 00:28:13,416
I think my fish is a bit bigger, though.

437
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:17,212
Why don't we stop now?

438
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:20,048
I think we're tied.
Let's just go for just one more hour.

439
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,466
Okay, one hour.

440
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:26,680
Hey.

441
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:29,516
Ha-ri, why is your hand so warm?

442
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,268
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

443
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:34,104
Are you all right?

444
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:40,860
Let me go with you.

445
00:28:42,612 --> 00:28:43,697
I'll take care of it.

446
00:28:58,795 --> 00:29:01,256
Hang in there.
We'll be at the hospital in ten minutes.

447
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,383
It's okay. I don't need
to go to the hospital.

448
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:04,801
Just listen to me!

449
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:14,477
<i>-Mr. Kang?</i>
-I'm busy right now. Let's talk later.

450
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:21,401
You must be busy.

451
00:29:21,484 --> 00:29:22,902
Let's go straight to Seoul.

452
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,453
Excuse me.

453
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:34,581
Sung-ho!

454
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:39,169
Welcome.

455
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:46,801
<i>If I'm being honest,</i>

456
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:52,599
I fell for you at first sight
when I met you at the convenience store.

457
00:29:53,266 --> 00:29:55,518
Is it okay to run around
with something like this?

458
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:57,062
Not okay, right?

459
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:02,192
Ta-da!

460
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:03,943
-Guess what this is.
-Poop?

461
00:30:04,778 --> 00:30:07,197
How does this look like poop?
It's a flower.

462
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:13,411
Oh, I'm sorry.

463
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:22,128
<i>She's pretty.</i>

464
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:29,886
<i>I found my love.</i>

465
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,516
I'm sorry.

466
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,934
It's no problem.

467
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:41,564
<i>Should I ask? Or not?</i>

468
00:30:43,566 --> 00:30:44,401
Excuse me.

469
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:47,696
<i>It was love at first sight for me, too.</i>

470
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:49,698
But she said she liked me.

471
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:53,201
Why is she saying she wants to
forget about last night?

472
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,889
We're here? You should have woken me up.

473
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,559
I couldn't since you were
sleeping so soundly.

474
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,311
-Are you feeling better now?
-Yes.

475
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,107
Since I got treated and got some sleep,

476
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,358
I feel a lot better now.

477
00:31:30,739 --> 00:31:33,241
Hi, Mr. Mattis. I'm actually
in the middle of something right now.

478
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,118
I'll call you right back. Bye.

479
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:40,707
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

480
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:47,213
Why do you keep apologizing?

481
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:48,673
Well, that's…

482
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,302
You wasted your time
just to act like my boyfriend,

483
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:57,932
and you had to go through all that trouble
today with the boat and everything.

484
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,225
Don't be sorry.

485
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,770
I did it all because I wanted to.

486
00:32:04,314 --> 00:32:05,190
What?

487
00:32:09,986 --> 00:32:11,905
I should get going now.

488
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:13,072
Get home safely.

489
00:32:31,174 --> 00:32:32,258
Ms. Shin.

490
00:32:35,178 --> 00:32:36,471
Do you really not know?

491
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:45,814
Why I spent the entire weekend
pretending to be your boyfriend

492
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,233
when I hate wasting my time
more than anything?

493
00:32:49,275 --> 00:32:52,654
Why I went through your social media
to find out the things you like,

494
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,739
and why I put off my meetings for you?

495
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,116
Do you really not know?

496
00:32:58,284 --> 00:32:59,285
What?

497
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:01,371
I have feelings for you.

498
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:07,043
I know it must feel sudden.
It's the same for me, too.

499
00:33:07,544 --> 00:33:10,129
I was too jealous of Chef Lee

500
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:12,924
to realize you were feeling sick.

501
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,425
I'm an idiot.

502
00:33:17,053 --> 00:33:20,139
So stop apologizing to me.

503
00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:22,433
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

504
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,651
President Kang

505
00:33:32,902 --> 00:33:34,028
has…

506
00:33:36,823 --> 00:33:37,949
feelings for me?

507
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,120
Am I in a dream?

508
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,622
It doesn't hurt.

509
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:52,338
Ha-ri, I went to the mall today!

510
00:33:52,422 --> 00:33:56,175
And when I saw these clothes,
I knew that they were made for you.

511
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:57,886
-Come on, let's try it on.
-What?

512
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,512
That looks great. Try it on.

513
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,015
-Try it on. Yes.
-Right now?

514
00:34:02,098 --> 00:34:03,099
No.

515
00:34:03,182 --> 00:34:05,602
I'll try it on tomorrow.
I'm too tired right now.

516
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:06,603
-You're tired?
-Yes.

517
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:08,313
Look how tired your eyes look.

518
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:12,233
What kind of company makes an employee
work so hard even on the weekends?

519
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:17,947
Well, some fried chicken shop makes
their only son work as a delivery guy

520
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:19,532
even on the weekends.

521
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,202
But how could you
only buy new clothes for Ha-ri?

522
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:25,747
Why you little…

523
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,041
Do you know how much money
I've had to pay so far

524
00:34:28,124 --> 00:34:30,627
because of the trouble that you caused?

525
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,922
Is that something to say to your mom?
Stop right there, you!

526
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,548
Get down here!

527
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:36,716
Whatever!

528
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:38,051
Why you little!

529
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,448
-Here!
-Thanks.

530
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,283
You're wearing the clothes I bought you?

531
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,953
They look so good on you!
My daughter's so pretty.

532
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,037
-Really?
-Yes.

533
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,205
Hold on!

534
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:10,083
You can't go out wearing that.

535
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,417
-Why not?
-Why?

536
00:35:12,293 --> 00:35:13,920
You look too pretty.

537
00:35:14,003 --> 00:35:16,172
What if all the guys
start following you around?

538
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,675
That's true.

539
00:35:18,758 --> 00:35:21,135
You take after me
and can make any outfit shine.

540
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:23,805
-I'm going to work.
-Bye.

541
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,226
<i>Wait.</i>

542
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,937
<i>If I dress nicely
the day after I was asked out,</i>

543
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,650
<i>he'll think I'm trying
to look good for him. Gosh.</i>

544
00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:39,487
Why are you going back in?

545
00:35:40,113 --> 00:35:42,490
To change. I can't afford to look pretty.

546
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:48,997
Did she go crazy?

547
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,833
You punk, watch what you say
about your sister!

548
00:35:56,647 --> 00:35:58,190
I should get going.

549
00:36:00,651 --> 00:36:02,194
I know that you must be flustered

550
00:36:03,487 --> 00:36:04,822
because it's out of the blue.

551
00:36:07,283 --> 00:36:10,870
I won't rush you, so take your time to
think things over and let me know.

552
00:36:20,755 --> 00:36:22,673
I shouldn't have told her
to take her time.

553
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:25,885
I should have given her a deadline.

554
00:36:26,928 --> 00:36:28,804
-Sir, Chairman Kang is--
-Move, you fool!

555
00:36:29,597 --> 00:36:32,808
You. Just what do you think you're doing?

556
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:35,186
Why are you so angry?

557
00:36:35,269 --> 00:36:36,437
You really don't know?

558
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:40,232
Look at this. What's all this?

559
00:36:41,192 --> 00:36:42,318
What is it?

560
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,114
This is ridiculous.

561
00:36:55,748 --> 00:36:58,000
Who sent you these pictures?

562
00:36:58,084 --> 00:37:00,628
That was Chairman Park's hotel.

563
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:04,423
I thought you went on a date with Ms. Shin
over the weekend.

564
00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:06,884
Who's that woman?

565
00:37:06,968 --> 00:37:09,053
I can't tell you that yet.

566
00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:11,889
What? You crazy bastard!

567
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:15,726
Are you really going to cheat on Geum-hui?

568
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,520
-You bastard, you!
-No, it's not--

569
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,605
-Hey! Stop right there!
-It's a misunderstanding.

570
00:37:19,689 --> 00:37:20,564
Grandfather!

571
00:37:21,232 --> 00:37:22,858
-Stop!
-Don't give me that!

572
00:37:22,942 --> 00:37:25,319
-Grandfather.
-I have the evidence right here, punk.

573
00:37:25,903 --> 00:37:29,740
You even asked the hotel employees
to get her some new clothes too?

574
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,535
And you went sailing on my yacht.

575
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:36,872
I knew I did a bad job of raising you
but you're taking it to a whole new level.

576
00:37:36,956 --> 00:37:40,084
-How could you do that?
-Grandfather, sir!

577
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:41,252
You bastard!

578
00:37:41,335 --> 00:37:42,420
Hey!

579
00:37:44,046 --> 00:37:44,964
Grandfather, stop.

580
00:37:47,008 --> 00:37:48,092
I had my reasons.

581
00:37:48,175 --> 00:37:49,135
What reasons?

582
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,594
All right.

583
00:37:50,678 --> 00:37:54,056
Let's hear what you have to say.

584
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:01,647
I broke up with Geum-hui.

585
00:38:03,274 --> 00:38:04,150
What?

586
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:05,234
I ended it.

587
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:09,030
So I'm not cheating on her
even if I'm seeing another woman.

588
00:38:09,113 --> 00:38:11,157
Didn't you break up because you cheated?

589
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,784
That's not the case at all, sir.

590
00:38:13,868 --> 00:38:17,329
How can I trust you
when you two are in cahoots?

591
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:21,292
My, God! What on earth is this?

592
00:38:22,376 --> 00:38:24,420
Jeez, I'm getting dizzy.

593
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:27,673
Why did you tell him that
you broke up with Shin Geum-hui?

594
00:38:27,757 --> 00:38:29,341
It had to be done eventually.

595
00:38:29,425 --> 00:38:31,135
I can't tell him they're the same people.

596
00:38:31,218 --> 00:38:32,136
That's true.

597
00:38:36,057 --> 00:38:38,601
CHAIRMAN KANG HAS SENT YOU A TEXT

598
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:41,228
He's already telling me
to set up your blind dates again.

599
00:38:42,313 --> 00:38:46,233
Why don't you tell Ms. Shin your feelings
and bring her to the chairman?

600
00:38:47,026 --> 00:38:47,902
I've already…

601
00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:50,738
confessed my feelings to her.

602
00:38:50,821 --> 00:38:51,739
What?

603
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,951
You didn't get rejected, did you?

604
00:38:57,244 --> 00:38:58,245
Rejected?

605
00:38:58,996 --> 00:39:00,623
I'm still waiting for an answer.

606
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,628
I told her that I would give her time,
that she could think over it slowly.

607
00:39:06,754 --> 00:39:08,047
You've been rejected.

608
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,343
I said, I wasn't!

609
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,222
IT WAS DELICIOUS
I LOVE YOU!

610
00:39:17,056 --> 00:39:20,226
I was really
craving this spicy <i>tteokbokki</i> today.

611
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:22,728
What is it? Why were you so stressed out?

612
00:39:22,812 --> 00:39:25,356
Please, I don't even know where to start.

613
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:28,651
I have something to say, too.

614
00:39:29,902 --> 00:39:32,613
They say friends take after
one another. What's your story?

615
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:36,659
So…

616
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:41,080
Where do I even start?

617
00:39:41,914 --> 00:39:44,458
If you're going to take all day,
I'll just go first.

618
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:51,507
I slept with Sung-hoon.

619
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:55,427
What?

620
00:39:56,178 --> 00:39:57,471
I slept with him,

621
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:02,351
but I couldn't remember any of it,
so I just ran out of there.

622
00:40:04,145 --> 00:40:06,105
-What?
-I must be crazy.

623
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:11,277
I'm shocked that you slept with him
and you don't even remember it.

624
00:40:12,236 --> 00:40:13,863
I'm speechless.

625
00:40:13,946 --> 00:40:15,781
Hey, I feel exactly the same!

626
00:40:15,865 --> 00:40:18,075
I'm going to go insane!

627
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,036
How can I not remember
sleeping with someone?

628
00:40:22,246 --> 00:40:25,040
You know how much I like Sung-hoon, right?

629
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:30,629
Then how can I not remember
such an important moment?

630
00:40:30,713 --> 00:40:32,339
Still, how could you
tell him to forget it?

631
00:40:32,923 --> 00:40:34,216
He must have been shocked.

632
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,052
It was just because I was so flustered.

633
00:40:37,136 --> 00:40:39,054
You should have just told him the truth.

634
00:40:39,138 --> 00:40:40,139
Hey!

635
00:40:40,723 --> 00:40:41,765
How could I do that?

636
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:46,478
Then he'll think that I do that
whenever I'm drunk.

637
00:40:47,229 --> 00:40:48,647
It'll hurt his pride, too.

638
00:40:50,274 --> 00:40:51,275
That's true.

639
00:40:53,777 --> 00:40:55,321
So, what are you going to do?

640
00:40:55,905 --> 00:40:56,780
I have no idea.

641
00:40:59,116 --> 00:41:01,744
Hey, so, what's your thing?

642
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,706
Never mind. It's fine.
We can talk about it later.

643
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:09,627
DA-HYE

644
00:41:15,466 --> 00:41:16,425
Why?

645
00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:18,052
What?

646
00:41:18,636 --> 00:41:20,095
-What?
-Why are you so surprised?

647
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:21,639
Surprised? I'm not.

648
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:23,849
Fine, don't tell me.

649
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,477
What are you hiding from me? I'm curious.

650
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,521
DA-HYE
THANKS TO YOU, WE'VE HAD A GREAT TIME

651
00:41:29,605 --> 00:41:30,439
What is this?

652
00:41:32,983 --> 00:41:34,818
What's this picture?

653
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:37,029
So, that…

654
00:41:37,738 --> 00:41:40,741
"Tell your boyfriend I said hi?"

655
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,661
What are they talking about?

656
00:41:43,744 --> 00:41:46,121
Why are they calling President Kang
your boyfriend?

657
00:41:48,374 --> 00:41:49,708
It's a long story.

658
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,296
<i>I knew it!</i>

659
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,924
You remember that bastard
who took secret videos of us?

660
00:41:57,007 --> 00:42:00,010
I heard President Kang helped
all of his past victims file lawsuits

661
00:42:00,094 --> 00:42:01,136
<i>against him.</i>

662
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,097
<i>I thought it was weird,</i>

663
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,474
but he only did it
because he was into you!

664
00:42:09,144 --> 00:42:10,396
I have feelings for you.

665
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,234
I won't rush you, so take your time
to think things over and let me know.

666
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:20,447
Just think how surprised
she must have been.

667
00:42:20,531 --> 00:42:23,617
So I gave her some time to think
because I was being considerate.

668
00:42:23,701 --> 00:42:24,660
Sure.

669
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:30,374
But how long does it usually take
to come to a decision?

670
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:34,420
Well, it's probably different
from person to person.

671
00:42:34,503 --> 00:42:35,337
Right.

672
00:42:39,258 --> 00:42:40,884
I shouldn't call her first

673
00:42:40,968 --> 00:42:43,554
when I said that I'd give her time, right?

674
00:42:43,637 --> 00:42:44,805
That's right.

675
00:43:00,154 --> 00:43:01,363
What the heck?

676
00:43:03,198 --> 00:43:04,700
Stupid spam call.

677
00:43:18,088 --> 00:43:20,924
My leg just cramped up all of a sudden.

678
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:26,388
Please stop making me feel so pathetic.

679
00:43:26,472 --> 00:43:27,389
Sorry?

680
00:43:27,473 --> 00:43:31,393
I'll pretend that night
never happened like you said.

681
00:43:31,477 --> 00:43:33,145
So please stop avoiding me.

682
00:43:34,688 --> 00:43:36,523
-That's not--
-Also…

683
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:39,026
I wasn't going to say this,

684
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:41,153
but I don't want my sincerity disregarded.

685
00:43:41,236 --> 00:43:44,198
I wasn't acting compulsively that night.

686
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:47,951
What do you--

687
00:43:48,035 --> 00:43:50,704
I was also interested in you ever since
I first saw you…

688
00:43:53,165 --> 00:43:54,166
at the convenience store.

689
00:43:56,085 --> 00:43:58,087
I should have kept my distance.

690
00:43:59,505 --> 00:44:00,464
I'm sorry.

691
00:44:23,112 --> 00:44:24,238
What are you doing?

692
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:28,325
Were you really interested in me
from the beginning?

693
00:44:28,408 --> 00:44:29,243
Really?

694
00:44:29,326 --> 00:44:31,161
Does any of that matter now?

695
00:44:32,996 --> 00:44:35,082
I wasn't avoiding you.

696
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:38,001
-I had my reasons--
-It's fine.

697
00:44:38,085 --> 00:44:39,461
I have nothing more to say.

698
00:44:39,545 --> 00:44:41,088
It's nothing like that…

699
00:44:42,923 --> 00:44:43,799
So…

700
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:46,844
Actually…

701
00:44:48,137 --> 00:44:50,764
I don't remember what happened that night.

702
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,224
What?

703
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:56,687
I don't remember anything…

704
00:44:58,689 --> 00:45:00,149
about sleeping with you.

705
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:06,238
I was so flustered, and that's why
I left after saying that it didn't count.

706
00:45:06,321 --> 00:45:07,197
So…

707
00:45:07,281 --> 00:45:08,282
Really?

708
00:45:09,032 --> 00:45:11,368
You really don't remember anything?

709
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:15,747
No.

710
00:45:17,374 --> 00:45:20,335
I know how crazy I must sound right now.

711
00:45:21,003 --> 00:45:23,046
But it's unfair for me, too.

712
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,257
How can I like you so much

713
00:45:26,466 --> 00:45:28,635
and not remember anything
about what happened?

714
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:32,055
I felt so shameful and embarrassed.

715
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:37,853
Did you just laugh?

716
00:45:39,396 --> 00:45:40,314
Why?

717
00:45:40,814 --> 00:45:42,482
Because you're so adorable.

718
00:45:43,483 --> 00:45:44,359
Adorable?

719
00:45:45,068 --> 00:45:47,404
You're not mad or shocked or anything?

720
00:45:48,405 --> 00:45:49,281
No.

721
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,953
But back there, you said that
we should draw a line again.

722
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:57,247
Let's make that null and void.

723
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,542
And, from now on…

724
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,130
I'll make sure that you never forget.

725
00:46:23,774 --> 00:46:26,360
THE NEXT DAY

726
00:46:27,778 --> 00:46:29,321
What's this?

727
00:46:29,404 --> 00:46:30,447
A COLLABORATION WITH THE CHEF PRODUCT

728
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,490
WHITE KIMCHI RAVIOLI
IS AT THE TOP IN SALES

729
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:36,245
The president is here.

730
00:46:47,089 --> 00:46:47,965
My face is so dry.

731
00:46:55,889 --> 00:46:56,723
What's with him?

732
00:46:57,516 --> 00:46:59,059
Didn't he say he liked me?

733
00:47:00,143 --> 00:47:01,436
What's wrong with me?

734
00:47:02,145 --> 00:47:03,730
Why are you disappointed

735
00:47:03,814 --> 00:47:05,274
when you're going to reject him?

736
00:47:06,775 --> 00:47:07,776
You're funny, Ha-ri.

737
00:47:09,611 --> 00:47:13,448
AND THE NEXT DAY

738
00:47:14,116 --> 00:47:18,620
DELICIOUSLY SPICY
<i>TTEOKBOKKI</i>

739
00:47:21,331 --> 00:47:23,709
"Deliciously Spicy <i>Tteokbokki</i>"
is one of our products.

740
00:47:24,501 --> 00:47:25,794
I came up with that.

741
00:47:27,087 --> 00:47:28,213
What?

742
00:47:28,297 --> 00:47:30,299
Why do I keep thinking of Mr. Kang?

743
00:47:31,591 --> 00:47:32,759
President Kang is here.

744
00:47:32,843 --> 00:47:35,971
AND THE DAY AFTER THAT

745
00:47:40,726 --> 00:47:42,185
<i>We live in two different worlds.</i>

746
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:43,437
Hello, sir.

747
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,772
<i>The president and I can't be a couple.</i>

748
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:49,860
What? The girl's face
isn't even in the picture.

749
00:47:49,943 --> 00:47:51,737
Right? What a shame.

750
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,196
I wonder who she is.

751
00:47:53,822 --> 00:47:54,823
It's obvious.

752
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:58,702
She's super pretty
or went to a really good school.

753
00:47:58,785 --> 00:48:00,579
Or she's from a really wealthy family.

754
00:48:00,662 --> 00:48:02,706
Or she's all three.

755
00:48:02,789 --> 00:48:05,334
<i>They're probably imagining
some incredible girl.</i>

756
00:48:05,417 --> 00:48:08,295
<i>How shocked would they be
if they found out that it's just me?</i>

757
00:48:08,378 --> 00:48:10,881
We'll submit the proposal as soon
as it's put together.

758
00:48:11,673 --> 00:48:14,551
Stop being so vague and set an exact date!

759
00:48:14,634 --> 00:48:17,346
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to just wait?

760
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:18,680
Sir?

761
00:48:24,728 --> 00:48:29,524
While go food's sales revenue
is on the rise in the United States,

762
00:48:29,608 --> 00:48:32,527
there are other countries
that are trying to compete with us,

763
00:48:32,611 --> 00:48:35,238
so I believe a more aggressive strategy
will be necessary.

764
00:48:35,322 --> 00:48:37,074
People tend to think of Korean food

765
00:48:37,157 --> 00:48:40,619
as "home food," or as healthy food
that's made with love and care.

766
00:48:41,244 --> 00:48:42,704
Let's focus on that.

767
00:48:42,788 --> 00:48:43,830
Yes, sir.

768
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:52,172
It's already been a week.

769
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:53,673
President Kang?

770
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:55,384
Is there a problem?

771
00:48:56,718 --> 00:48:58,011
No.

772
00:48:58,095 --> 00:48:59,805
How's the package revision plan?

773
00:48:59,888 --> 00:49:03,558
In order to cater to local customers
who are used to buying things in bulk,

774
00:49:03,642 --> 00:49:08,063
we are discussing a possible solution
of selling four packs in one box.

775
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:11,608
Let's keep the English label of
"MANDU" on the package.

776
00:49:11,691 --> 00:49:14,486
-Keeping the Korean aspect of it.
-Yes, sir.

777
00:49:16,571 --> 00:49:18,156
CHAIRMAN

778
00:49:25,288 --> 00:49:26,915
Food product development teams,

779
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:29,543
start developing dumplings
suitable for localization.

780
00:49:30,127 --> 00:49:31,044
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

781
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:37,676
CHAIRMAN

782
00:49:45,976 --> 00:49:48,478
ADDITIONAL FILMING PROPOSAL

783
00:49:48,562 --> 00:49:52,399
SUGGESTED CAST
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 1

784
00:49:55,944 --> 00:49:58,947
When are the additional shoots
taking place?

785
00:50:01,408 --> 00:50:03,285
Look at that.

786
00:50:04,286 --> 00:50:05,912
This bastard.

787
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:09,374
Find out where he is, right now!

788
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:11,042
Yes, sir.

789
00:50:11,543 --> 00:50:12,627
Come on.

790
00:50:14,629 --> 00:50:16,715
Where's Ms. Kim? The shoot starts soon.

791
00:50:18,091 --> 00:50:19,968
I think she went to the bathroom.

792
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:22,888
I'm jealous of Ms. Kim.

793
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:25,557
I wanted to do the shoot.

794
00:50:26,433 --> 00:50:29,603
What's there to be jealous
about appearing in a promo video?

795
00:50:29,686 --> 00:50:31,313
You don't get paid much for it.

796
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:36,401
Still, it's a chance to show everyone I
represent the researchers in the company.

797
00:50:36,485 --> 00:50:38,195
And get on the president's good side.

798
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:41,948
Where have you been?

799
00:50:42,532 --> 00:50:43,909
I went to get a calming pill.

800
00:50:43,992 --> 00:50:45,660
Again? You already had some.

801
00:50:45,744 --> 00:50:48,330
Didn't you say you haven't
eaten anything since yesterday?

802
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:49,915
Will you be okay on an empty stomach?

803
00:50:49,998 --> 00:50:52,042
I'll be fine.
Let's hurry over to the studio.

804
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:53,126
Okay, let's go.

805
00:50:57,633 --> 00:50:58,551
Hello.

806
00:50:59,552 --> 00:51:00,887
Hello!

807
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:02,347
Hello, Chef Lee.

808
00:51:03,097 --> 00:51:07,101
Isn't it nice that you're the center
of attention for these additional shoots?

809
00:51:07,185 --> 00:51:08,394
It's all thanks to you.

810
00:51:09,062 --> 00:51:10,313
Please.

811
00:51:10,396 --> 00:51:11,647
How'd you know?

812
00:51:12,607 --> 00:51:14,817
-Treat us to a meal next time!
-Sure.

813
00:51:14,901 --> 00:51:16,611
By the way, where's Ha-ri?

814
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,448
I think Ms. Shin went to the bathroom
with Ms. Kim.

815
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,159
We have a problem.

816
00:51:23,242 --> 00:51:24,118
What?

817
00:51:24,827 --> 00:51:25,912
Ms. Kim…

818
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:31,125
Those pills are so effective!

819
00:51:32,668 --> 00:51:34,170
How many did she take?

820
00:51:34,754 --> 00:51:36,506
I think, like three?

821
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:37,965
Three?

822
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,720
How will she do the shoot like this?
It's starting soon.

823
00:51:43,513 --> 00:51:45,390
We have no choice. I'll get ready.

824
00:51:45,473 --> 00:51:47,100
-Don't.
-Okay.

825
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:49,477
Ms. Shin, get ready.

826
00:51:51,062 --> 00:51:52,730
-Me?
-Yes!

827
00:51:53,356 --> 00:51:54,732
You're friends with Chef Lee

828
00:51:54,816 --> 00:51:57,276
and you will be much better than him.

829
00:52:11,207 --> 00:52:13,876
WHITE KIMCHI RAVIOLI

830
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,753
Are you feeling better?

831
00:52:16,421 --> 00:52:18,881
Yes. That was such a long time ago.

832
00:52:19,757 --> 00:52:21,843
Okay, stand by.

833
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:24,679
Let's do this.

834
00:52:31,102 --> 00:52:33,980
You said that you would wait
until Ms. Shin contacted you first.

835
00:52:35,148 --> 00:52:38,234
Don't worry. I'm just going
to catch a glimpse of her quietly.

836
00:52:38,317 --> 00:52:40,236
All right, let's get started.

837
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,154
Sure.

838
00:52:42,238 --> 00:52:43,823
Damn it, where is she?

839
00:52:52,498 --> 00:52:54,542
Wait. Why are those two
shooting it together?

840
00:52:56,252 --> 00:52:58,921
Should I cut up the vegetables
while you're cooking, Chef?

841
00:52:59,005 --> 00:53:00,089
Yes, please.

842
00:53:00,173 --> 00:53:01,382
Sure. Okay.

843
00:53:06,137 --> 00:53:08,347
You really know how to handle a knife.

844
00:53:09,932 --> 00:53:12,810
Well, my family runs a fried chicken shop.

845
00:53:12,894 --> 00:53:16,481
So I've been chopping up things like
cabbages ever since I was young.

846
00:53:16,564 --> 00:53:17,982
Is that so?

847
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,906
Are the onions ready?

848
00:53:24,989 --> 00:53:26,240
Just a moment.

849
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:42,048
Cut!

850
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:44,133
Blood!

851
00:53:44,967 --> 00:53:46,427
Hey, are you all right, Ha-ri?

852
00:53:46,511 --> 00:53:47,637
Yes.

853
00:53:48,846 --> 00:53:52,934
This isn't blood. I accidentally pressed
on the sauce bottle. I'm sorry.

854
00:53:53,518 --> 00:53:54,393
I'm okay.

855
00:54:06,322 --> 00:54:07,865
My God. Why…

856
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:09,659
Why is he here?

857
00:54:13,913 --> 00:54:14,872
Could it be…

858
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,334
because he wants to hear my answer?

859
00:54:26,759 --> 00:54:27,927
It's been a while.

860
00:54:32,181 --> 00:54:33,307
Hello, President Kang.

861
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:42,400
Thank you?

862
00:54:42,483 --> 00:54:44,193
What are you thanking me for?

863
00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:46,696
It's, I…

864
00:54:48,823 --> 00:54:52,827
I heard that you personally took care
of the guy who secretly filmed us.

865
00:54:53,786 --> 00:54:54,996
Thank you. I mean it.

866
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:03,838
-Chairman Kang is on his way.
-What?

867
00:55:10,553 --> 00:55:12,555
You go.

868
00:55:14,765 --> 00:55:15,725
Hey.

869
00:55:15,808 --> 00:55:16,684
Hello, sir.

870
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:19,186
Where did Tae-moo go?

871
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,688
I'm not sure, sir.

872
00:55:20,771 --> 00:55:21,856
What?

873
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,899
That's…

874
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,779
-This way.
-This way?

875
00:55:37,747 --> 00:55:40,583
That little brat.

876
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,253
God, my legs.

877
00:55:44,337 --> 00:55:45,755
I'm so tired.

878
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:46,839
-Oh, my.
-Sir.

879
00:55:48,049 --> 00:55:50,968
Where is he? Tell him to come out at once!

880
00:55:51,052 --> 00:55:52,470
Sir, the employees will hear.

881
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:55,264
You. Go tell him

882
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:58,517
to start going on blind dates again

883
00:55:58,601 --> 00:56:01,687
if he's not going to get back together
with Geum-hui.

884
00:56:02,188 --> 00:56:04,023
Sir, please calm down.

885
00:56:04,106 --> 00:56:05,524
Calm down?

886
00:56:05,608 --> 00:56:08,235
I'm getting dizzy. Gosh, I'm exhausted.

887
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,904
-Let's go, sir.
-That little brat.

888
00:56:10,738 --> 00:56:11,906
Why that little…

889
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:16,535
I told my grandfather that we broke up.

890
00:56:17,495 --> 00:56:20,831
After all, I can't introduce you
as Shin Geum-hui forever.

891
00:56:20,915 --> 00:56:22,249
Go on the blind dates.

892
00:56:24,627 --> 00:56:25,586
Are you

893
00:56:26,754 --> 00:56:28,422
rejecting me right now?

894
00:56:32,468 --> 00:56:33,761
What's the reason?

895
00:56:33,844 --> 00:56:34,929
The reason…

896
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,724
There's a lot of them.

897
00:56:39,976 --> 00:56:43,604
What would your grandfather say
if he knew about this situation?

898
00:56:43,688 --> 00:56:45,314
Not to mention the other employees.

899
00:56:45,398 --> 00:56:47,316
I'm not asking about others.

900
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,068
I only want to hear

901
00:56:50,027 --> 00:56:51,070
what you think.

902
00:56:52,446 --> 00:56:53,406
It's the same.

903
00:56:56,617 --> 00:56:58,494
I don't think it's going to work out.

904
00:56:59,704 --> 00:57:01,122
Do you really not have

905
00:57:02,623 --> 00:57:04,208
any feelings for me?

906
00:57:16,137 --> 00:57:17,096
I understand.

907
00:57:20,516 --> 00:57:22,018
Then let me say this again.

908
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:26,814
I have feelings for you, Ms. Shin.

909
00:57:28,858 --> 00:57:30,067
And I won't give up.

910
00:57:30,568 --> 00:57:32,945
If you reject me,
I'll ask you out again and again.

911
00:57:33,571 --> 00:57:34,989
Until you finally like me back.

912
00:57:35,698 --> 00:57:37,116
So, you need

913
00:57:38,409 --> 00:57:39,910
to brace yourself.

914
00:57:41,704 --> 00:57:44,749
Why do you keep making it so hard for me?

915
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:49,837
Why do you keep being nice to me
and make me think about you?

916
00:57:51,338 --> 00:57:55,843
You make me wonder if it really
might work out, even though I know

917
00:57:56,927 --> 00:57:58,054
that it never could.

918
00:58:00,306 --> 00:58:02,975
It's obvious
that I'm not the right girl for you.

919
00:58:04,226 --> 00:58:06,020
So why…

920
00:58:10,024 --> 00:58:11,817
Why do you keep making me want more?

921
00:58:13,903 --> 00:58:16,614
Stop liking me.

922
00:58:18,449 --> 00:58:20,534
Stop trying to get close to me.

923
00:58:24,246 --> 00:58:25,790
What you're worried about

924
00:58:26,916 --> 00:58:28,959
will never happen. I promise.

925
00:58:29,502 --> 00:58:30,419
So…

926
00:58:32,963 --> 00:58:34,340
stay by my side.

927
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:24,226
