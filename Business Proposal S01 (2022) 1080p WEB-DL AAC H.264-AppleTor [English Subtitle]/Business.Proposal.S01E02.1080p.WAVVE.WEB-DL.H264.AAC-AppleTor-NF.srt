00:00:00,057 --> 00:00:04,833
BUSINESS PROPOSAL

2
00:00:04,914 --> 00:00:06,791
EPISODE 2

3
00:00:13,757 --> 00:00:16,801
Damn it, this is what I was worried about!

4
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:20,305
I can't run into him looking like this!

5
00:00:33,026 --> 00:00:34,027
What are you doing?

6
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:36,154
I…

7
00:00:36,696 --> 00:00:37,864
So…

8
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:40,158
I have something I need to tell you.

9
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,118
-What is it?
-It's…

10
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,955
I just need a moment…

11
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:54,214
Before, you said that you never
wanted to see my face or marry me.

12
00:00:54,297 --> 00:00:55,507
So what are you doing right now?

13
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:59,052
Exactly.

14
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:01,971
Right. Not only do I not want
to see your face ever again

15
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:05,517
but I'm also not interested
in marrying you at all.

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,771
So I came back to tell you to never
contact me again. Okay, I'll be going now.

17
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:11,690
I'm still going to marry you.

18
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,695
What?

19
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:19,030
So tell me why you don't want to marry me.

20
00:01:22,492 --> 00:01:24,536
I don't like everything about you.

21
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:29,040
I don't like how cheesy
your weird lines are

22
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:31,167
and how your face
looks like an archaeopteryx.

23
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:33,837
An archaeopteryx?

24
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:37,507
I'll be leaving now.

25
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,384
Oh, it's a green light.

26
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:45,015
An archaeopteryx?

27
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:47,851
What does that look like?

28
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,731
This is an archaeopteryx.

29
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:55,233
How do I look anything like this?

30
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:59,821
Just the overall vibe,
especially the nose.

31
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:00,739
What?

32
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:05,326
The resemblance is uncanny.

33
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:16,713
What? How can you laugh
in a situation like this?

34
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:19,591
No, I mean, the whole thing is hilarious.

35
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:23,303
So you're telling me,
you jumped in the car and said,

36
00:02:23,386 --> 00:02:24,471
"I don't want to marry you."

37
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:27,599
I had no choice. I couldn't
run into Min-woo looking like that.

38
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:29,768
Anyway, what do we do now?

39
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:32,395
He'll push ahead with the wedding
if we don't do something about it.

40
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,730
You're right.

41
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:36,065
Why does he even want
to get married so badly?

42
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:38,318
I told you,
he's probably after your family

43
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:40,361
so his family can become the wealthiest.

44
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:44,324
Even if the two companies merge,
that's still not enough capital, though.

45
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:46,951
Maybe he's actually just fallen for you.

46
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:48,536
That's impossible.

47
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,873
He's probably interested in
"Jin Young-seo from Marine Group."

48
00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:54,751
Anyway, go meet him
and clear this whole thing up.

49
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:55,794
Fine.

50
00:02:57,962 --> 00:02:59,214
I'm tired. Let's get going.

51
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,885
Come on. Let's go
for just one more round of drinks.

52
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:05,303
-What?
-If my dad comes back and finds out

53
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:08,515
that I made a complete mess
of the blind date, I'm dead.

54
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:13,770
Just one more drink. Think of it
as my last meal before I die, okay?

55
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:20,151
Fine. Let's go for another round.

56
00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:21,945
Let's go!

57
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:23,238
Young-seo.

58
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:26,658
Hey, Ha-ri.

59
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:29,327
What are you doing?

60
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:32,539
Remember that guy
I told you about last time?

61
00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:34,749
That's where we met.

62
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,501
What?

63
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:38,211
He was so my type.

64
00:03:38,294 --> 00:03:41,506
I think he works somewhere around here.
Let's wait a bit, please?

65
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:45,343
Wow, that guy's the reason you decided
to come here in the first place, isn't it?

66
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:46,761
You're right.

67
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:49,889
I mean, I've never felt so right
about anything else in my life.

68
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:53,560
So let's just wait for one more hour.
How's that sound?

69
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:57,355
Fine. Okay.

70
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:00,066
Just one hour! I'll pick up the tab here.

71
00:04:06,364 --> 00:04:09,909
Wow, can you believe these girls?

72
00:04:09,993 --> 00:04:13,204
After coming home drunk last night,
they drank even more.

73
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:15,999
Why I ought to…

74
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:17,834
Wake up!

75
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:20,003
-Don't you have to go to work?
-My head hurts.

76
00:04:21,045 --> 00:04:22,172
Mrs. Han.

77
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:24,507
Why did I fall asleep here?

78
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:27,010
-What are you doing here?
-I don't know.

79
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:29,095
Do you not remember
what happened yesterday?

80
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:30,597
Yesterday?

81
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:39,480
Look at this girl. Your sister's
not picking up her phone again.

82
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:42,525
This little brat. She's dead meat.

83
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:48,781
Ta-da!

84
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:51,242
I come bearing gifts.

85
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:54,829
This one's for Dad, Mom, and Ha-min.

86
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:57,165
And this one's for me!

87
00:04:57,248 --> 00:04:58,750
Look at you. Did you get into a fight?

88
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,461
Oh, right. Mom, I tripped over there.

89
00:05:01,544 --> 00:05:03,463
Would you look at yourself right now?

90
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:09,177
But these really nice police officers
drove us here, like this!

91
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,430
You got wasted and what? The police?

92
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:13,598
I can't believe you!

93
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,058
Just get inside!

94
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:16,351
She's here too!

95
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:19,896
Gosh, how much do you have to drink
to not be able to walk like this?

96
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:21,981
Good evening.

97
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:24,025
-Wow.
-Miss.

98
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:27,570
All right, miss. You're home now, okay?

99
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:31,908
No, I wasn't asking you
to help me find my house.

100
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:35,620
I was asking you to help me
find the man I'm destined to be with.

101
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,288
Hold on.

102
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:40,208
I've been telling you.

103
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:46,547
He's about this tall, and his eyes sparkle
like a little puppy's.

104
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:51,594
And his shoulders were as wide
as the Pacific Ocean. Whoosh, like that.

105
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:56,015
-That hurts!
-Young-seo, you can't do that to…

106
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:59,769
You're going to get into trouble
if you do that to the police.

107
00:05:59,852 --> 00:06:02,855
Come here. I'm so sorry.

108
00:06:03,356 --> 00:06:07,026
Hey! You haven't been hearing what
I've been trying to tell you all night.

109
00:06:08,486 --> 00:06:14,200
Is it so wrong that I want to meet the man
I'm destined to be with one more time?

110
00:06:14,283 --> 00:06:17,453
You've been going on and on
with that nonsense for hours now.

111
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:19,080
I'll rip your whole mouth off.

112
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:21,916
Young-seo!

113
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:25,503
Hey, what's wrong with your mouth?

114
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,715
Young-seo, your mouth's ripped!

115
00:06:28,798 --> 00:06:30,216
-It's ripped open?
-Let me see!

116
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:33,511
-It's ripped.
-It ripped!

117
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:38,516
No! Mom, fire, blood, needle!

118
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,226
Say, "Ah!"

119
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:45,189
I'm sorry, Young-seo!

120
00:06:45,273 --> 00:06:48,234
It hurts. My heart hurts.

121
00:06:48,318 --> 00:06:50,236
-I'm sorry.
-I think I'm going to throw up.

122
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,947
That doesn't sound good at all.
No throwing up.

123
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:55,616
She's never acted out her whole life,
but now here she is,

124
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,578
driving the dagger
into our hearts with this scene.

125
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:00,204
-I'm so sorry.
-Oh, it's okay.

126
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:01,331
I'll take those.

127
00:07:01,414 --> 00:07:02,623
Oh, you can give it here.

128
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:04,542
Thank you for your hard work.

129
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:08,338
I'll take care of this mess
and make sure they're sorry.

130
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:09,547
You can leave now.

131
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,840
-Oh, okay.
-Goodbye.

132
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:12,050
Good night.

133
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,593
-No throwing up.
-I'm sorry.

134
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:14,677
Take care, then.

135
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:17,221
Young-seo, you can't throw up.

136
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:20,099
Let's go for one more round.

137
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:26,647
Go upstairs right now!

138
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,489
Last night, we…

139
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:36,783
Let's cut back on drinking from now on.

140
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,910
Shall we?

141
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:40,161
-Yes.
-Okay.

142
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,334
I love you, Mom.

143
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:47,835
I love you, Ms. Han.

144
00:07:50,213 --> 00:07:52,215
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

145
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:59,222
About the wedding, we should
probably have it at our hotel, right?

146
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:01,349
What? The wedding?

147
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:04,727
Yes. I was going to talk about it
with Chairman Jin,

148
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:07,772
but he's on a business trip abroad
and isn't coming back until next week.

149
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,899
Does he not know time is of the essence?

150
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:12,402
You're thinking
about the wedding venue already?

151
00:08:12,485 --> 00:08:13,945
You hate wasting time.

152
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:17,156
Marriage is already on the table.
The faster we get this going,

153
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,660
the faster I'll get to see
some great-grandkids, right?

154
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:23,663
The thing is--

155
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:26,833
That girl used to cause
a scene on blind dates.

156
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:31,754
But she seems to have fallen in love
at first sight with my dear grandson.

157
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:36,300
You two are meant to be.

158
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,219
Oh, man.

159
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:42,140
-Your phone keeps ringing.
-What?

160
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:45,351
A NEW MESSAGE FROM JIN YOUNG-SEO

161
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:49,981
Indeed, she seems to have fallen
head over heels. She wants to see me.

162
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:51,399
Really? Let me see.

163
00:08:51,482 --> 00:08:52,442
Hey, show me.

164
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:53,443
Let's eat.

165
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,657
I got a text from President Kang.

166
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,953
"I'll tell you where we'll meet later."

167
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:07,707
Don't mess this up. Don't go around saying
anything stupid and blowing my cover.

168
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,584
Who showed up to the blind date again?

169
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:14,714
I hired her through an agency to act
the part. She's a complete stranger.

170
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:17,341
-Happy now?
-Just go and tell him that, okay?

171
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:19,093
-Okay. Let's go.
-Let's go.

172
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:20,219
It'll finally be over.

173
00:09:20,303 --> 00:09:22,472
Why does she want to see you again?

174
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:24,432
I thought she ended things last night.

175
00:09:24,515 --> 00:09:26,017
-Isn't it obvious?
-What is?

176
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,227
She realized I'm
too good of a man to reject

177
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:30,938
just to rebel against her father.

178
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:33,024
I don't think that's the case.

179
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:35,276
She said that you're cheesy

180
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:38,738
and that she doesn't like your face
because it looks like an archaeopteryx.

181
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:41,532
-Then why would she ask to see me again?
-I have no idea.

182
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:47,246
Wow, Ms. Jin really has a keen eye.

183
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,165
You really look like an archaeopter--

184
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:51,501
Stop talking about the archaeopteryx.

185
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,465
-They look exactly the same!
-Hey, what did you just say?

186
00:09:58,257 --> 00:09:59,467
Wait, Mr. Cha!

187
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,010
That looks good.

188
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:03,888
Right, about the mackerel.
How's the curing coming along?

189
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,474
-I'll pan-fry them today.
-Okay

190
00:10:06,557 --> 00:10:09,227
I guess I'll stink all day again.

191
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:13,689
If I knew I'd be doing this all day,
I never would've started working here.

192
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:14,690
I know, right?

193
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:17,360
Please, Ms. Shin,
don't say things you don't mean.

194
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:19,779
You're always so excited
when you're working.

195
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:22,532
-Me? I am?
-Yes.

196
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:27,662
Wow, I can't believe it.

197
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:33,042
The more I find out about President Kang,
the more I learn we have a lot in common.

198
00:10:35,086 --> 00:10:36,462
What do you have in common?

199
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,382
Rumor has it that

200
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:42,510
President Kang was the top of his class
when he was at Harvard.

201
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:45,304
I was also the top of my class
for a semester in college.

202
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:49,016
Also, he got a gold medal at the Amateur
National Track and Field Championships.

203
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,226
You all know, right?

204
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:54,772
I am Gye Bin, the winner
of our company field day relay race.

205
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:57,483
Hey, what do you call this?

206
00:10:58,484 --> 00:10:59,860
Parallel universes.

207
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:01,904
How can we be so alike?

208
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:07,118
You know what? Then I have so many things
in common with Gianna Jun.

209
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:10,204
We both have two eyes, one nose, one mouth
and we're both women.

210
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:12,456
How dare you compare yourself
to my Gianna?

211
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,959
Then why do you keep saying things
to tick me off?

212
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,795
I know you have
no intention of ever getting married.

213
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,213
Here they go again.

214
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:22,091
To other female employees,
it's really useful information.

215
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:25,094
It could be an opportunity
to climb up the ladder, you know?

216
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:26,053
What?

217
00:11:26,137 --> 00:11:27,054
Sure, okay.

218
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:31,142
Goodness, how do you always know
exactly what to say

219
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:32,977
-to get your face smashed in?
-What?

220
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,604
Stop saying "female employees."
They're just employees.

221
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:37,815
Don't you know that's sexist?

222
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:39,942
And, what, climb up the ladder?

223
00:11:40,026 --> 00:11:42,361
The only thing that's climbing
is my blood pressure.

224
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:44,655
So stop it
and get those invoices submitted.

225
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:47,742
That's why she's still single.

226
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:53,998
INCOMING CALL
MIN-WOO

227
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,002
Hi, Min-woo.

228
00:11:58,502 --> 00:11:59,920
-Min-woo?
-Oh, okay.

229
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,217
-Ms. Yeo.
-Yes?

230
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:07,136
May I step out for a moment?

231
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:09,597
Who was that on the phone?
You sound so happy.

232
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,015
Yes, it's…

233
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,099
my fling.

234
00:12:12,183 --> 00:12:14,602
Wow, that was a loud whisper.

235
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:16,437
Okay.

236
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,109
What? Min-woo's her fling?

237
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:23,736
A fling.

238
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:25,029
Ms. Kim.

239
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:29,033
I'm asking because I'm curious,
but what exactly is a fling?

240
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:32,453
Is that what you call the phase
before you start to actually date…

241
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:35,164
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:36,082 --> 00:12:38,125
I should ask someone who'd know.

243
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:40,378
I'm really sorry.

244
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:46,550
What do you mean?
I have a lot of experience in that area.

245
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:49,095
Feel free to ask me.

246
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:50,888
No, I'm sorry for asking.

247
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:11,117
What? Are those two really a thing?

248
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:18,541
There's no way.

249
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,253
They've only met a couple of times
during our team dinners.

250
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:23,963
Right.

251
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:29,969
What's with all the touching?

252
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:35,099
Were they close enough to exchange gifts?

253
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,435
He's leaving?

254
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:38,727
Wait!

255
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:41,355
What do I do?

256
00:13:55,828 --> 00:13:58,497
Ha-ri, you're so pathetic.

257
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:00,416
What are you even doing?

258
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,517
Have you taken care of that thing
we talked about yesterday?

259
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:20,603
-Yes, sir. It's taken care of.
-Excuse me.

260
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:24,774
Sorry.

261
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,786
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:44,043
Sir, are you all right?

263
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:49,757
Who was it?

264
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:52,510
Who threw this at my face?

265
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:54,762
Sir, your nose is bleeding.

266
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:56,889
My nose is bleeding?

267
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:02,311
That woman in the white lab coat.

268
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:04,647
Oh, come on!

269
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:08,359
President Kang!

270
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:13,489
Please open this for me.

271
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:16,951
I'm so out of breath.

272
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,918
What, why?

273
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:39,056
Stop right there!

274
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,057
Damn it!

275
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,852
That little… Damn it!

276
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,448
Damn.

277
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:06,375
President Kang!

278
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:10,504
Everyone's going to see.

279
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:27,813
Oh, no!

280
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,655
What are you doing here?

281
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:38,782
She must be a researcher.

282
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:41,160
The Food Product Development Team
is upstairs.

283
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:42,494
No, she went this way.

284
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:35,881
This slipper belongs to you, doesn't it?

285
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,094
I'm asking you why you threw this at me.

286
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:45,641
I didn't mean to.
It was a mistake, I slipped.

287
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:47,351
SENIOR RESEARCHER
SHIN HA-RI

288
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,731
Ms. Shin Ha-ri, I can't hear
a word you're saying.

289
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:57,069
I didn't mean to. It was a mistake.
I slipped. I'm sorry.

290
00:17:58,112 --> 00:17:59,363
Then why did you run?

291
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:03,909
<i>I can't say it's because I thought you
might recognize my face!</i>

292
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:08,706
I was surprised
because your nose was bleeding. I'm sorry.

293
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,344
Put it back on.

294
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:24,638
Thank you.

295
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:29,852
The Bucket List Fish was your work, right?

296
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:31,437
Yes.

297
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,064
And the vegetarian
dumplings campaign too, right?

298
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,608
Yes.

299
00:18:38,777 --> 00:18:41,280
Huh? That proposal wasn't ever approved.
How did you--

300
00:18:41,363 --> 00:18:43,449
I remember
because the idea was pretty good.

301
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:45,659
Right?

302
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:49,288
If you think about it,
my ideas were ahead of their time.

303
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:50,581
It would be perfect now.

304
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:54,209
Being vegan is trending these days.
Vegetable dumplings without calories!

305
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:56,837
It would have been popular
with the vegetarians

306
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,840
as well as with anybody on a diet.
It's such a shame.

307
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:05,804
My mackerel!
The curing should be done by now!

308
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,931
I'll be going now.

309
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:12,519
She acts awfully strange,
but I like the way she works.

310
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:18,609
What's up? What's bothering you?

311
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:21,570
What? Oh, no.

312
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:26,867
This is no time to be working.
Do you know what happened?

313
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,953
Some employee threw a slipper
at President Kang

314
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:32,206
in the lobby on the first floor.

315
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:35,042
He even got a nosebleed!

316
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:40,255
Hey, Ms. Kim. You were
on the first floor earlier, right?

317
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:41,465
Did you see anything?

318
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,717
I didn't see anything.

319
00:19:44,927 --> 00:19:48,806
You said you were going to see your fling.
What's with all the head banging?

320
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:52,017
As of today, I'm no longer in a fling.

321
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:56,814
The guy I was talking about
was Chef Lee Min-woo.

322
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,858
Oh, Min-woo?

323
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:02,903
You're talking about Ms. Shin's friend
who was at the restaurant

324
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:05,531
when we were having our company dinner?
The handsome guy?

325
00:20:05,614 --> 00:20:06,740
Oh, that guy?

326
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:08,867
Wait, but you barely know him.

327
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:12,371
Well, he was totally my type,
so I texted him first,

328
00:20:12,454 --> 00:20:15,040
and I even left him a present
at his restaurant.

329
00:20:15,124 --> 00:20:18,127
Then why is it already over?
You even gave him a gift.

330
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,294
Right.

331
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:21,630
He said he felt uncomfortable or whatever.

332
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:25,926
Oh, I see.

333
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:30,347
I'm going to go take out the mackerel now.

334
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,357
Can't you read the room?

335
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,359
What? What did I do?

336
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,487
Don't you know Chef Lee
already has someone he's interested in?

337
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:46,613
No way.

338
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:50,325
Ms. Yeo, have you no shame?

339
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:52,911
He's young enough to be your nephew.

340
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:54,788
Don't even think about it!

341
00:20:54,872 --> 00:20:56,999
Don't you click those pincers at me!

342
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:58,333
Not me.

343
00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:07,885
Damn it, that's hot!

344
00:21:09,094 --> 00:21:11,805
Let's see, how about here?

345
00:21:12,723 --> 00:21:14,766
What's this?

346
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,352
Who the hell parked like this?

347
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:24,109
Oh, come on.

348
00:21:28,197 --> 00:21:31,617
Why is everything
in my life so difficult these days?

349
00:21:39,374 --> 00:21:42,044
Aren't you the guy
from the convenience store?

350
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:45,339
Oh, hello. How did you remember?

351
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:48,759
<i>It'd be hard to forget anybody who looks
as good as you do.</i>

352
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:50,844
I'm good at remembering people's faces.

353
00:21:50,928 --> 00:21:53,722
Anyway, I'm in a bit of a hurry right now.

354
00:21:54,973 --> 00:21:56,600
Call me.

355
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:59,144
<i>Please. Call me.</i>

356
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:03,440
Team Leader Jin Young-seo
from Marine Group?

357
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,861
-You're Jin Young-seo?
-Yes.

358
00:22:07,945 --> 00:22:09,112
Is there a problem?

359
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:10,822
There is a big problem.

360
00:22:10,906 --> 00:22:12,366
Ms. Fake Jin Young-seo.

361
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:19,539
Don't you know that it's a crime
to use someone else's name and identity?

362
00:22:19,623 --> 00:22:22,125
What? What do you mean someone else's?

363
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:23,835
Who are you anyway?

364
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,089
I went on a blind date with
the real Jin Young-Seo a few days ago.

365
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:32,552
Are you saying you're Kang Tae-moo?

366
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:39,935
Why does my man of destiny
have to see me like this?

367
00:22:40,018 --> 00:22:41,269
What?

368
00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:43,522
No, it's nothing.

369
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:46,358
Ms. Jin.

370
00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:49,236
Who's the fake Jin Young-seo
who went on the blind date with me?

371
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:53,740
I don't know. I hired her through
an agency to act the part.

372
00:22:53,824 --> 00:22:57,035
I don't know her face or name.
She's a complete stranger.

373
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,787
A complete stranger?

374
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:00,455
Yes.

375
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:09,047
But the bag that the woman brought
to the date looked exactly that one.

376
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:10,048
What?

377
00:23:10,716 --> 00:23:12,718
There's no way.

378
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:15,012
Hers was Chanel,
and this is Saint Laurent.

379
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:16,805
They're two very different bags.

380
00:23:16,888 --> 00:23:18,265
You have no clue.

381
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:22,144
Chanel and Saint Laurent?
I thought she was a complete stranger.

382
00:23:22,227 --> 00:23:24,563
How did you know what kind of bag she had?

383
00:23:24,646 --> 00:23:25,647
Right, how did I?

384
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:28,775
The elders in our families
will be very angry with you

385
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:30,736
when they realize what you've been up to.

386
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:32,446
Are you okay with that?

387
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:34,740
Are you going to tell them
the whole truth?

388
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:38,660
Can't you just say it didn't work out
once we saw each other again?

389
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:40,328
And we decided not to get married?

390
00:23:42,873 --> 00:23:44,166
Then, before any of that,

391
00:23:46,084 --> 00:23:47,377
bring her here first.

392
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:48,503
Who?

393
00:23:48,587 --> 00:23:49,588
The woman

394
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:52,257
who I almost married.

395
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:55,635
Why isn't she responding to her texts?

396
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:03,727
<i>Yep, it's all good now. Don't worry.</i>

397
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:06,813
What a relief.

398
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:12,360
This is driving me crazy.
What do you expect me to do?

399
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:22,579
JOY ART ACADEMY

400
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:27,709
Here's the bud,
and right here are the leaves.

401
00:24:27,793 --> 00:24:32,047
Oh, it's fine. I scribbled more
than he did anyway. Here you go.

402
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,299
That woman was Jin Young-seo, huh?

403
00:24:42,808 --> 00:24:44,017
You're back?

404
00:24:44,101 --> 00:24:46,478
Please leave my house alone.

405
00:24:47,312 --> 00:24:48,730
How can I leave it alone?

406
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:52,234
Why do you always leave such
a mess, Sung-hoon?

407
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:58,698
-Did you buy what I asked for?
-Here.

408
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:01,201
And let me tell you again.

409
00:25:01,284 --> 00:25:04,454
It's not a mess. I just have my own way
of organizing things.

410
00:25:04,538 --> 00:25:05,789
Unpack them.

411
00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:44,661
Now that you've cleaned and cooked,

412
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,621
-do you feel less stressed?
-Yeah.

413
00:25:46,705 --> 00:25:49,457
You sure have a weird way of de-stressing.

414
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,168
How is it weird?

415
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:54,379
I put in time and effort,
and the result reflects that.

416
00:25:54,462 --> 00:25:55,755
It's productive.

417
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,926
Anyway, since the Jin Young-seo
who came to the blind date was a fake,

418
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,553
I guess the marriage is off.

419
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:03,013
Why would that make any sense?

420
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:06,308
She dared to waste my time
and made me say all those things.

421
00:26:06,391 --> 00:26:10,270
I guess the last thing Ms. Jin wanted
was to be in an arranged marriage, too.

422
00:26:10,353 --> 00:26:12,355
It's not something to be so mad about.

423
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:14,858
I'm talking about the fake Ms. Jin,
not the real one.

424
00:26:15,817 --> 00:26:17,944
She was just a replacement and said what?

425
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:20,447
Cheesy? An archaeopteryx?

426
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:25,243
That's a weird direction
you're taking with your anger.

427
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:26,953
I can't forgive her.

428
00:26:27,037 --> 00:26:30,081
I'll have my revenge soon enough.

429
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:50,018
When did you get here?

430
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:51,311
Just now.

431
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:56,483
Hey, did President Kang
get mad at you for trying to fool him?

432
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:57,400
What?

433
00:26:57,484 --> 00:27:00,820
It's just, there was a rumor at work
that he's a really scary guy.

434
00:27:00,904 --> 00:27:02,697
He fired executives who betrayed him.

435
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:05,200
Let's stop talking
about what's already over.

436
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:08,036
Why don't we blow off some stress
and go out somewhere?

437
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:10,705
Where?

438
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:14,584
Go ahead and try on anything you want.

439
00:27:16,795 --> 00:27:17,754
That one?

440
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,798
Next.

441
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:24,261
I think this one looks the best!

442
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:27,013
What's gotten into you?
Buying me all these clothes?

443
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:30,100
I know that you've been stressed
these days because of me.

444
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:33,436
I'm getting all pampered for going out
on one little blind date for you?

445
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:39,359
Wait, are you--

446
00:27:39,442 --> 00:27:41,278
Am I what?

447
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:43,905
Don't ask me to go on
another blind date for you.

448
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:47,325
I'm not going to do it ever again!

449
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:50,078
Don't worry, I won't ever ask again.

450
00:27:51,621 --> 00:27:54,040
Make her look nice, please!
Make her shine!

451
00:27:57,168 --> 00:27:58,962
-Hey.
-Yeah.

452
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:00,547
Say cheese!

453
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,464
Let's do this!

454
00:28:04,342 --> 00:28:07,470
Are you sure that beauty salon is really
the one celebrities use?

455
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:09,097
Look at how intense my makeup is.

456
00:28:10,515 --> 00:28:12,934
That's because I asked them
to do it like that.

457
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:14,853
What's that supposed to mean?

458
00:28:16,938 --> 00:28:19,524
Ha-ri. Listen to me carefully.

459
00:28:20,025 --> 00:28:22,485
-President Kang will be here soon.
-What? Who's coming?

460
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:24,529
I didn't have a choice!

461
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:27,407
He realized we were friends
and asked to meet you.

462
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,576
Then you should've
pretended not to know me!

463
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:31,745
But then he said he'd find out on his own!

464
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:34,456
What if he finds out you're his employee?

465
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:36,666
You could've at least warned me.

466
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,793
Then you wouldn't have come here.

467
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:41,671
Anyway, he thinks you owe him an apology.

468
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:43,381
-Just say you're sorry.
-What?

469
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:46,092
What's the worst that can happen?
Okay, I'm going now.

470
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:47,927
-You're leaving?
-Oh, right!

471
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:51,848
Don't forget and be sure to wear the wig.

472
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,433
-A wig?
-Sorry.

473
00:28:53,516 --> 00:28:56,394
-I'm sorry!
-Wait, Young-seo!

474
00:28:56,478 --> 00:28:57,479
Young-seo!

475
00:28:57,562 --> 00:29:00,565
I knew I had a bad feeling about this!

476
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:01,608
Damn it.

477
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:09,115
Hold on!

478
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:10,742
What do I do?

479
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:12,535
I don't know!

480
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:16,790
Oh, damn it.

481
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:22,879
Why did this have to spill right now?

482
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:30,553
Oh, thank you.

483
00:29:31,096 --> 00:29:32,222
Oh, my.

484
00:29:34,432 --> 00:29:37,102
We meet again, Ms. Fake Jin Young-seo.

485
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:53,952
You work at a fried chicken shop?

486
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:55,537
What?

487
00:29:56,913 --> 00:29:58,665
Oh, that.

488
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:01,418
I can just call and check.

489
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:05,505
My family runs a fried chicken… shop, yes.

490
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:08,174
<i>Damn it, I told him where I live, too.</i>

491
00:30:09,968 --> 00:30:11,052
How much?

492
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:14,264
Plain fried chicken is 15,000 won
and the spicy one is 17,000 won.

493
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:15,473
I wasn't talking about--

494
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:18,101
About the chicken.

495
00:30:19,436 --> 00:30:22,021
How much did you get paid
to impersonate Jin Young-seo?

496
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:26,276
That's…

497
00:30:26,943 --> 00:30:27,819
So…

498
00:30:27,902 --> 00:30:29,904
Just lay it out honestly.

499
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:36,286
I kept on telling her I couldn't do it,
that I really couldn't do it,

500
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:40,415
but then she just kept telling me
she would pay me 800,000 won.

501
00:30:40,498 --> 00:30:42,876
So, that's how it all happened.

502
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:47,130
You tried to scam me
for merely 800,000 won?

503
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,468
Going as a replacement
isn't technically a scam, is it?

504
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:53,344
You pretended to be another person.

505
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:56,765
You deliberately wasted someone's
precious time for your own benefit.

506
00:30:56,848 --> 00:30:58,641
If that's not a scam, what is it?

507
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,895
I'm sorry.

508
00:31:02,395 --> 00:31:03,897
I urgently needed some money,

509
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,150
and it wasn't an amount that I could
handle with my monthly paycheck.

510
00:31:08,943 --> 00:31:12,614
I thought you were just a regular
old scammer, but you have a job, too?

511
00:31:12,697 --> 00:31:14,657
You've got some skills, yeah?

512
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:19,454
Oh, I mean it's just
a small, medium-sized company.

513
00:31:19,537 --> 00:31:21,456
Yeah, real small…

514
00:31:22,373 --> 00:31:26,252
<i>And that company is actually yours.</i>

515
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:32,217
I wonder if he brought that
handsome secretary along again.

516
00:31:35,595 --> 00:31:38,056
No. This is no time to think about men

517
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:40,391
when you've just thrown your friend
to the wolves.

518
00:31:42,727 --> 00:31:44,854
I'm sorry, dear friend.

519
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:53,822
Anyway, he thinks you owe him an apology.
Just say you're sorry.

520
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:56,574
<i>I didn't do anything wrong</i>

521
00:31:56,658 --> 00:31:59,118
<i>besides hiding the fact
that I'm an employee of his.</i>

522
00:32:04,332 --> 00:32:08,545
<i>But it'd be my loss if he finds out
who I am just because I made him mad.</i>

523
00:32:10,713 --> 00:32:12,882
I know that a simple apology
won't be enough.

524
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:14,926
I wish I could make it up to you

525
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:18,012
for all of the time you wasted
and for your hurt feelings,

526
00:32:18,096 --> 00:32:19,889
but there isn't a way to do that.

527
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:22,642
And it's not like I can pay you back
in money or gifts,

528
00:32:22,725 --> 00:32:25,144
as you already have so
much more than I do.

529
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:29,691
What I can do is promise that I'll do
everything in my power to help you out

530
00:32:29,774 --> 00:32:31,568
if you ever need a favor.

531
00:32:35,905 --> 00:32:37,615
Are you still mad?

532
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,122
In what way,

533
00:32:45,373 --> 00:32:47,083
do I look like an archaeopteryx?

534
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,794
Sorry?

535
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:54,215
Oh, is that why you're angry?

536
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:55,967
It's not that I'm angry,

537
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:59,387
it's just that I've never heard
such nonsense before,

538
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,806
so I was caught off-guard, yes.

539
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,641
Oh, that.

540
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:07,020
I just said whatever popped into my head

541
00:33:07,103 --> 00:33:09,647
because I wanted you
to stop asking me to marry you.

542
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:11,274
Whatever popped into your head?

543
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:14,110
But the resemblance is there.

544
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:16,779
Your small face, your sharp eyes,
and your lanky limbs.

545
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:19,032
No one has ever told you that?

546
00:33:19,115 --> 00:33:21,784
Didn't I just tell you
that I've never heard it before?

547
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:23,286
Oh, right.

548
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,288
I'm sorry.

549
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:29,042
<i>That's really why he got so angry?</i>

550
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:31,544
<i>Wow, hold a grudge much?</i>

551
00:33:31,628 --> 00:33:32,754
Well,

552
00:33:32,837 --> 00:33:34,881
if there's not much else for us
to talk about,

553
00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:37,383
would it be okay
if we wrapped things up about now?

554
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:42,472
We're still looking for part-timers
at my family's chicken shop,

555
00:33:42,555 --> 00:33:44,474
so I help out in the evenings.

556
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:46,935
I think it'll be best for me
to get going--

557
00:33:47,894 --> 00:33:49,938
INCOMING CALL
DON'T ANSWER

558
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,152
Save my name again.
And pick up when I call from now on.

559
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:58,613
If you don't answer my calls,
or try to disappear…

560
00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:02,450
I will come and find you.

561
00:34:06,371 --> 00:34:07,330
Okay.

562
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,752
Also, what's your actual name?

563
00:34:13,336 --> 00:34:14,379
My name?

564
00:34:14,462 --> 00:34:15,838
Shin Ha--

565
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:20,218
<i>If I give him my real name,
he might recognize me later on.</i>

566
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:23,596
Geum… hui.

567
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,181
Geum-hui.

568
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,810
SHIN GEUM-HUI

569
00:34:30,603 --> 00:34:32,647
Archaeopteryx.

570
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,026
I wonder if Ms. Geum-hui
can manage a smile today?

571
00:34:41,864 --> 00:34:44,117
I'll have the cheese pork cutlet.

572
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,201
Yes, sir.

573
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,330
What kind of rich folks would meet up
at a pork cutlet franchise

574
00:34:49,414 --> 00:34:51,374
to see all their in-laws?

575
00:34:53,543 --> 00:34:55,086
Either way, I'm still jealous.

576
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:59,632
It'd be nice to meet some in-laws
at a pork cutlet restaurant.

577
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:01,551
I'm home.

578
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:03,511
You're just getting back?

579
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:06,305
Everything went well with Ms. Jin?

580
00:35:06,889 --> 00:35:08,558
So what about the wedding?

581
00:35:08,641 --> 00:35:10,977
Both of our families should
meet first, right?

582
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,604
I decided not to marry Ms. Jin Young-seo.

583
00:35:13,688 --> 00:35:15,898
What? What do you--

584
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:20,695
Well, that's what happened,
so please don't bring her up anymore.

585
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:24,657
That little--

586
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:26,284
<i>I can't agree to this marriage.</i>

587
00:35:26,993 --> 00:35:29,871
<i>No, I won't agree.</i>

588
00:35:30,747 --> 00:35:33,249
The person I really love is Geum-hui.

589
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,334
-Shin Geum-hui.
-Gwang-bok!

590
00:35:36,377 --> 00:35:41,716
You dare insult my daughter all because
of some girl from the fried chicken shop?

591
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:51,142
That must have hurt. I bet the crust
on that cutlet was really crispy.

592
00:35:51,726 --> 00:35:56,230
Anyway, whether it's in real life
or on television,

593
00:35:56,314 --> 00:36:00,485
why is it so hard to get married,
these days?

594
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:05,406
Shin Geum-hui.

595
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,742
<i>BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI</i>

596
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:10,953
Shin Geum-hui.

597
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:14,999
Why did I suddenly think of that name?

598
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,644
I feel like I've heard it somewhere.
Shin Geum-hui.

599
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:19,361
<i>Your call has been forwarded to voicemail…</i>

600
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,696
Wow, she's turned her phone off, huh?

601
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,866
You just wait until I find you,
Young-seo. I will destroy you.

602
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:34,042
Ha-ri, you're back!

603
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,503
Jin Young-seo!

604
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:38,004
Calm down.

605
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:40,882
You! You're a really bad person!

606
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:42,676
Hey, what are you doing?

607
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:46,054
Please!

608
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:49,891
I'm sorry.

609
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:52,435
I didn't know my phone was turned off.

610
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:54,771
I swear I wasn't ignoring you
on purpose, really.

611
00:36:54,854 --> 00:36:56,189
Save it!

612
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:59,484
Good thing I was quick
and gave him a fake name.

613
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:02,904
Or else, he could've fired me
then and there!

614
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:04,864
What were you thinking, taking me there?

615
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,242
I'm really sorry.

616
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,452
You saw him, how charismatic he can be!

617
00:37:09,536 --> 00:37:11,788
I didn't have a choice.

618
00:37:11,871 --> 00:37:14,624
At least he doesn't know
that you're his employee so--

619
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:17,377
But he found out that my family
runs a fried chicken shop!

620
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,254
What? Wait, how?

621
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,757
I felt bad about skipping the birthday
party that my coworkers threw for me,

622
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:25,468
so I was bringing some coupons
and dropped them.

623
00:37:25,552 --> 00:37:29,389
Why would you bring those coupons
with you? You thoughtless idiot!

624
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,641
You have no right to be yelling
at me like that!

625
00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:33,685
It's all your fault!

626
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:35,395
Wearing this apron isn't going to--

627
00:37:35,478 --> 00:37:36,396
Ha-ri!

628
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,316
What are you doing? Why are you grabbing
Young-seo by the collar?

629
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,652
-No, this is--
-I'm all right, Mrs. Han.

630
00:37:42,736 --> 00:37:44,821
Also, don't scold Ha-ri, please.

631
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:46,823
It's all my fault, and I deserve it.

632
00:37:46,906 --> 00:37:48,700
I mean, how bad could it have been?

633
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:51,244
You can't grab your friend
by the collar like this!

634
00:37:51,327 --> 00:37:53,038
You and your temper! Let go now!

635
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:55,165
-Let go of her, come on!
-What?

636
00:37:55,665 --> 00:37:57,792
Mom, you don't know anything!

637
00:37:58,585 --> 00:38:01,880
If you like Young-seo so much, why don't
you just raise her instead of me?

638
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:04,090
-I mean, really--
-Look at that temper.

639
00:38:04,174 --> 00:38:05,592
Why do you have to be so mean?

640
00:38:05,675 --> 00:38:08,845
Mrs. Han! It's all my fault, I'm sorry!

641
00:38:08,928 --> 00:38:11,431
-Wow, look at you.
-What?

642
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:13,433
Both of you, stop!

643
00:38:18,313 --> 00:38:23,818
Who did she get that hot temper
from, anyway? Really!

644
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:26,321
Does she really not know
who she gets it from?

645
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,782
Why can't she get along with her friend?

646
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:31,785
You should count yourself lucky
Young-seo stays by your side.

647
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:34,496
If I had a daughter like Young-seo,
I'd be so happy!

648
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:35,538
I know, right?

649
00:38:35,622 --> 00:38:39,209
Mom, don't you wish that
you had a daughter like Young-seo?

650
00:38:39,292 --> 00:38:40,543
Do you want me to seduce her?

651
00:38:40,627 --> 00:38:42,796
To have a "daughter"-in-law. It'd be nice.

652
00:38:43,296 --> 00:38:45,965
Even if you tried,
you think that would work?

653
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:47,842
What do you mean, a "daughter"-in-law?

654
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,637
It's just a daughter-in-law!
Just fold your laundry.

655
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:55,934
<i>You should take this chance
to buy this kimchi product.</i>

656
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:57,393
This early in the morning?

657
00:38:57,477 --> 00:38:59,562
I told them to mind the scheduling.

658
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:02,065
<i>Call to place--</i>

659
00:39:02,148 --> 00:39:05,985
<i>The archaeopteryx is considered
to be the ancestor of all modern birds.</i>

660
00:39:06,903 --> 00:39:11,324
<i>Fossil samples were discovered
in limestone in Solnhofen, Bavaria.</i>

661
00:39:12,408 --> 00:39:14,327
<i>The archaeopteryx lived at the end</i>

662
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,497
<i>of the Jurassic period, in the southern
part of modern-day Germany.</i>

663
00:39:18,665 --> 00:39:20,375
Freaking Jurassic, damn it.

664
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:25,421
<i>You can see that the length of the body
is about 30 to 50 centimeters long,</i>

665
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:27,215
<i>which is about the size of a raven.</i>

666
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,551
<i>This was a bird with a small head
and large eyes…</i>

667
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,024
Hello?

668
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:47,485
Ms. Geum-hui?

669
00:39:48,444 --> 00:39:50,572
What's he saying?

670
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,241
Why is anyone prank calling at this hour?

671
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,452
It's not a prank call.
Are you still half-asleep? Ms. Geum-hui.

672
00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:57,996
I'm not Geum--

673
00:40:05,587 --> 00:40:08,173
Sorry, you just surprised me.

674
00:40:08,256 --> 00:40:09,591
Why did you call?

675
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,092
I just called to make sure

676
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,803
you didn't get a new number
to cut me off. That's all.

677
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:15,138
Okay.

678
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:16,681
Hello?

679
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:19,601
What?

680
00:40:20,268 --> 00:40:22,478
It's four in the morning.
Has he lost his mind?

681
00:40:22,562 --> 00:40:25,773
What the heck? I'm totally awake now.
Is he insane?

682
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:28,193
This guy is so annoying! Really!

683
00:40:28,735 --> 00:40:30,236
He's so annoying.

684
00:40:32,238 --> 00:40:34,824
<i>Here, you can observe its teeth.</i>

685
00:40:35,617 --> 00:40:36,951
An archaeopteryx?

686
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,161
<i>There are three-clawed…</i>

687
00:40:38,244 --> 00:40:40,622
I hope she gets a terrible night's sleep.

688
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:43,249
<i>On the tail, there are 20 to 21 tail--</i>

689
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:49,172
Why are you yawning
first thing in the morning?

690
00:40:49,255 --> 00:40:50,757
You didn't sleep well?

691
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,427
I just had trouble going back
to sleep in the middle of the night.

692
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:56,179
Okay.

693
00:40:58,473 --> 00:41:00,600
Did you all hear? You haven't, right?

694
00:41:00,683 --> 00:41:02,602
Again, I'm the only one
who's heard, right?

695
00:41:02,685 --> 00:41:04,062
Okay. Focus, everyone.

696
00:41:04,145 --> 00:41:06,648
Apparently, President Kang
went on a blind date.

697
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:11,486
Jeez, what's the big deal?
It has nothing to do with us.

698
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,781
There you go again.
You have to see the big picture here.

699
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:17,200
It has everything to do with us!

700
00:41:17,283 --> 00:41:19,160
Rich people will always stick together.

701
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:20,578
There might be a merger.

702
00:41:20,662 --> 00:41:23,581
That'll have a huge impact
on stock prices.

703
00:41:23,665 --> 00:41:26,417
You barely have a few dozen shares
of the company stock.

704
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:29,963
Why are you making such a big deal of it
as if you're some major shareholder?

705
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:34,092
I have a grand total of 50 shares.

706
00:41:34,175 --> 00:41:35,593
That all adds up, you know?

707
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:45,311
Anyway, stop talking about President Kang.

708
00:41:45,395 --> 00:41:47,188
He may be the president of our company,

709
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:49,983
but he's someone we might never run into.

710
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:52,235
Are you a pro-wrestler?
How are you so strong?

711
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:53,695
<i>Right?</i>

712
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,533
<i>Please, help me so I never have
to run into that man, dear Buddha.</i>

713
00:41:58,616 --> 00:41:59,701
<i>Dear God.</i>

714
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,666
You asked for me?

715
00:42:06,749 --> 00:42:08,835
Yes. With the factory in Ilsan,

716
00:42:08,918 --> 00:42:11,671
when are we planning to restart
the second production line?

717
00:42:11,754 --> 00:42:15,300
They said it would take at least a week
to finish all of the replacement work.

718
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:17,969
And today's the first day at work
for Mr. Hwang, right?

719
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:20,763
Mr. Park's replacement?
Let's have lunch with him today.

720
00:42:20,847 --> 00:42:23,808
Actually, your schedule has changed
starting from lunch today.

721
00:42:23,891 --> 00:42:26,894
What? What do you mean?
Without so much as a word to me?

722
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:29,480
The order came from the chairman himself.

723
00:42:29,564 --> 00:42:31,441
I'm scheduling the dates for you again.

724
00:42:31,524 --> 00:42:32,525
What?

725
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:36,904
So that's how it's going to be, huh?

726
00:42:37,613 --> 00:42:39,490
Han Min-hui. Daemang Industries.

727
00:42:39,574 --> 00:42:41,993
She majored in piano
at the Juilliard School of Music,

728
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:44,537
and she's currently working toward
a doctorate at Seoul National University.

729
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,497
<i>People say it's a shame</i>

730
00:42:46,581 --> 00:42:48,499
that I have to get married
with this career.

731
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:53,379
But I think bringing a child
that has my good genetics into this world

732
00:42:53,463 --> 00:42:55,298
and raising it is also worthwhile.

733
00:42:55,381 --> 00:42:58,301
<i>The second daughter of the Minister of
Justice. Graduate of Harvard Med School.</i>

734
00:42:58,384 --> 00:43:00,845
<i>Seeing as she's from Harvard too,
you two should have a lot in common.</i>

735
00:43:00,928 --> 00:43:02,805
You know Professor Albert, right?

736
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:05,266
Yes, he was my advisor.

737
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:08,144
He taught a business course
that I took as an elective,

738
00:43:08,227 --> 00:43:10,605
and I remember him speaking
very highly of you.

739
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,524
Your senior thesis…

740
00:43:16,444 --> 00:43:20,656
-Mr. Kang? I've heard a lot about you.
-You're even better looking than I heard.

741
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,075
And you're so tall.

742
00:43:22,158 --> 00:43:23,951
I love how you look so calm.

743
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:25,453
-You're my type.
-You're my type.

744
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,413
When I told my family about you…

745
00:43:27,497 --> 00:43:29,040
All the elders were thrilled.

746
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:31,376
This is the first time
I've felt like this, so…

747
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:32,585
-my heart is fluttering.
-My heart is fluttering.

748
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:35,421
Oh, look at me rambling on.

749
00:43:39,258 --> 00:43:43,012
Do you think there's any other person
who goes on ten blind dates in a day?

750
00:43:43,096 --> 00:43:44,597
Probably not.

751
00:43:45,264 --> 00:43:49,102
You'll set a new record for the most blind
dates in the shortest amount of time.

752
00:43:52,271 --> 00:43:54,690
You hit the wrong button.
Why did you press the roof?

753
00:43:54,774 --> 00:43:56,234
I didn't press the wrong one.

754
00:43:57,193 --> 00:43:58,569
It's not over yet.

755
00:43:58,653 --> 00:43:59,862
What?

756
00:43:59,946 --> 00:44:02,281
Her name is Yoko Hitori,
and her Korean name is Oh Eun-ji.

757
00:44:02,365 --> 00:44:05,034
A third-generation immigrant,
and the second-in-line for Hitori Foods.

758
00:44:15,002 --> 00:44:18,005
Did any of the ladies today
catch your eye?

759
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:19,632
-Not at all.
-What?

760
00:44:20,216 --> 00:44:22,927
They all seemed a lot better
than the fake Jin Young-seo,

761
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:24,887
who you decided to marry at first glance.

762
00:44:24,971 --> 00:44:27,390
At least the fake Jin Young-seo
wasn't boring.

763
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:29,851
How can they all say
the exact same things?

764
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:31,811
That is true.

765
00:44:31,894 --> 00:44:34,438
She sure was different from the others.

766
00:44:36,983 --> 00:44:38,734
President Kang, your nose is bleeding.

767
00:44:38,818 --> 00:44:40,611
My nose is bleeding?

768
00:44:40,695 --> 00:44:42,405
Damn it.

769
00:44:44,031 --> 00:44:46,033
Stupid nosebleeds.

770
00:44:49,537 --> 00:44:50,830
You're late.

771
00:44:51,414 --> 00:44:53,082
How were the blind dates?

772
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:55,626
Don't you think this is a bit much?

773
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,754
Do you have any idea
how many blind dates I just went on?

774
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:02,925
You went over to Japan
to make it to number 11.

775
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:07,597
How was today? Did you like
any of the ladies you met today?

776
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,098
I can't believe you.

777
00:45:09,182 --> 00:45:10,558
Stop overreacting.

778
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:17,190
You're the one who got me all excited,
saying you would marry Jin Young-seo.

779
00:45:17,773 --> 00:45:19,483
And then, what? You call it off?

780
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:22,612
-Are you toying with your grandfather?
-That's not it.

781
00:45:22,695 --> 00:45:24,906
Stop making excuses and keep your promise!

782
00:45:31,996 --> 00:45:35,499
Meet the rest tomorrow, up to number 20.

783
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:38,085
And if there's still no lady
that you like,

784
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:42,715
I'll find a year's worth of eligible women
you can go on dates with.

785
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,720
LIST OF BLIND DATE CANDIDATES

786
00:45:49,305 --> 00:45:51,474
I have a woman who I want to marry.

787
00:45:53,392 --> 00:45:54,227
What?

788
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:56,354
You have someone you want to marry?

789
00:45:56,437 --> 00:45:57,396
Yes.

790
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,608
You're always buried in your work.
When did you have the time--

791
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,945
No matter how busy I am,
I still have the time to meet women.

792
00:46:05,238 --> 00:46:07,156
You should've said that
from the beginning.

793
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,283
Then why did you go on
all those blind dates?

794
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:13,454
And why would you say all that nonsense
about marrying Ms. Young-seo?

795
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:16,791
The truth is, we broke up for a little bit
because we had a fight.

796
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,292
So I did it out of anger.

797
00:46:22,004 --> 00:46:23,297
Is he telling the truth?

798
00:46:23,923 --> 00:46:26,050
You should thank Mr. Cha.

799
00:46:26,133 --> 00:46:28,344
He's the reason we made up
and got back together.

800
00:46:32,932 --> 00:46:35,059
Yes, sir. I tried very hard.

801
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:38,604
So when will you introduce her to me?

802
00:46:38,688 --> 00:46:40,898
I'll set up a meeting in the near future.

803
00:46:40,982 --> 00:46:42,316
Set a date immediately.

804
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,193
I need to ask her when she's available.

805
00:46:45,486 --> 00:46:48,739
That means no more blind dates
for me, right?

806
00:46:49,323 --> 00:46:50,574
Sure.

807
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:52,743
If you had told me beforehand,

808
00:46:52,827 --> 00:46:55,955
I wouldn't have set up
such an overwhelming schedule like today.

809
00:46:56,038 --> 00:46:57,957
So you're aware that it was overwhelming?

810
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:01,377
All right, do what you need to do.

811
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,628
I'll be going now.

812
00:47:06,966 --> 00:47:08,134
Be good.

813
00:47:19,979 --> 00:47:21,147
President Kang?

814
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:22,982
How could you tell that kind of lie

815
00:47:23,065 --> 00:47:25,318
when you don't have
a woman you're marrying?

816
00:47:25,401 --> 00:47:27,028
How will you get out of this one?

817
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:28,029
What do you think?

818
00:47:28,863 --> 00:47:32,491
I'm going to tell the person in charge
to take responsibility.

819
00:47:32,575 --> 00:47:33,993
INCOMING CALL
ARCHAEOPTERYX

820
00:47:36,078 --> 00:47:39,206
What is this? I already apologized
and settled the whole thing.

821
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,000
So annoying.

822
00:47:43,836 --> 00:47:46,630
-Hello?
-Let's meet after you get off of work.

823
00:47:46,714 --> 00:47:48,382
What? Why?

824
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:49,800
I'm busy.

825
00:47:49,884 --> 00:47:52,136
-Should I go to your house, then?
-What? No!

826
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:57,767
I mean, I'm going to be late today.

827
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,686
I'm working overtime, so I'll be at work.

828
00:48:04,398 --> 00:48:05,983
Where do you work, Ms. Shin?

829
00:48:06,067 --> 00:48:07,943
Where do I work?

830
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:10,946
It's pretty far from Seoul, actually.

831
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,532
Far, where? I even went to Japan today.

832
00:48:13,616 --> 00:48:15,034
Is it farther than Japan?

833
00:48:15,868 --> 00:48:16,827
What?

834
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:20,623
<i>What? Ilsan?</i>

835
00:48:20,706 --> 00:48:22,541
<i>Why Ilsan all of a sudden?</i>

836
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:24,960
I don't know. The words popped out.

837
00:48:25,044 --> 00:48:27,421
<i>Wow, seriously?
So what are you going to do?</i>

838
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:30,633
I'm meeting him
at some coffee shop near the subway.

839
00:48:30,716 --> 00:48:33,052
I'm actually almost there.
I'll call you later. Bye!

840
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:36,764
What? He's already there?

841
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:40,643
Hello?

842
00:48:40,726 --> 00:48:44,230
<i>I'm at the coffee shop.
Are you sure you're a regular, here?</i>

843
00:48:44,313 --> 00:48:47,274
-Of course, why?
-<i>Nothing. It just seems a bit strange.</i>

844
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,235
Rainbow Cafe, right? That's the one.

845
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:51,112
I had coffee there yesterday, too.

846
00:48:54,156 --> 00:48:55,032
Thank you.

847
00:48:55,116 --> 00:48:57,284
I'm here. Wait just a second.

848
00:49:05,751 --> 00:49:07,253
Where's Rainbow Cafe?

849
00:49:11,424 --> 00:49:14,260
You're really a regular here?

850
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:19,265
Yes, I am. I really like the vibe here.

851
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:24,728
Mom, he pushed me!

852
00:49:26,522 --> 00:49:28,691
I'm not your mom.

853
00:49:28,774 --> 00:49:29,817
I'm so sorry.

854
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:39,994
You like this kind of vibe?

855
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:44,206
Well, sure, there's the vibe,
but the coffee is really good here.

856
00:49:49,044 --> 00:49:50,963
Could you make it quick?

857
00:49:51,046 --> 00:49:52,673
I need to head home soon.

858
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,967
This isn't the place to say such things,

859
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:01,390
but I want us to start dating.
With marriage in mind.

860
00:50:01,474 --> 00:50:02,433
What?

861
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:08,898
Did you fall in love at first sight when
you saw me on our blind date or something?

862
00:50:08,981 --> 00:50:11,400
It wasn't my plan for that to happen.

863
00:50:11,484 --> 00:50:13,402
You're getting ahead of yourself.

864
00:50:13,486 --> 00:50:15,154
I'm not saying
that we should actually date.

865
00:50:15,237 --> 00:50:17,907
Just pretend like we are, Ms. Shin.

866
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:19,158
What?

867
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:23,078
I won't do it. You've been calling me
a fraud and an imposter,

868
00:50:23,162 --> 00:50:25,915
and now you're asking me
to do it all over again?

869
00:50:25,998 --> 00:50:28,792
What else am I supposed to do?
You're the best person for the job.

870
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:31,378
The best person for the job?

871
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:33,506
You've proven your acting skills
on our date last time.

872
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:36,634
You already know my situation,
so I don't need to explain.

873
00:50:36,717 --> 00:50:38,677
And the secret is safe with you.

874
00:50:38,761 --> 00:50:41,847
Most importantly,
you wanted to repay your debt.

875
00:50:41,931 --> 00:50:44,308
Not to mention
all the precious time I'll save.

876
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:46,393
It's a win-win situation, is it not?

877
00:50:52,274 --> 00:50:54,068
I don't care who wins what.

878
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,612
I don't want to lie to other people again.

879
00:50:56,695 --> 00:50:58,280
I'll just forget
we ever had this conversation.

880
00:50:58,364 --> 00:50:59,907
You said you received 800,000 won?

881
00:51:03,327 --> 00:51:04,703
I'll double it.

882
00:51:06,622 --> 00:51:08,582
Double it?

883
00:51:12,253 --> 00:51:14,588
And that's every time
you meet with my grandfather.

884
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:18,259
He's a suspicious man, so it'll take
more than a couple of meetings.

885
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:28,894
<i>When I look back
at the short life that I've led so far,</i>

886
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,066
<i>I spent more time in debt
than I ever spent being happy.</i>

887
00:51:34,149 --> 00:51:35,359
Mom, Dad.

888
00:51:35,442 --> 00:51:39,947
We have nothing to say as your parents.

889
00:51:40,447 --> 00:51:43,367
STUDENT LOANS, CREDIT CARDS,
COLLATERAL LOANS, NEGATIVE ACCOUNTS

890
00:51:48,497 --> 00:51:54,295
DEBT

891
00:52:11,145 --> 00:52:13,188
PAYCHECK FROM KBBQ RESTAURANT

893

895
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:45,346
PAYCHECK FROM LOADING AND UNLOADING BOXES

896
00:52:46,347 --> 00:52:48,974
Bye, debt!

897
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:54,938
Mom, Dad.

898
00:52:55,022 --> 00:52:57,816
I got into a major company!

899
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,658
I'm sorry, Ha-ri.

900
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,494
Ha-ri.

901
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,288
ECONOMIC DAILY
CHICKEN INDUSTRY IN PERIL

902
00:53:11,372 --> 00:53:12,498
EPIC FAIL

903
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:14,708
<i>I might be able to
get rid of my debts at once.</i>

904
00:53:16,752 --> 00:53:18,212
<i>Should I just go for it?</i>

905
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:20,673
<i>No.</i>

906
00:53:20,756 --> 00:53:24,134
<i>Money is important,
but he's the company president.</i>

907
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:30,182
Have you made up your mind?

908
00:53:31,183 --> 00:53:33,227
I don't think I can do it. I'm sorry.

909
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,812
When you were apologizing
for deceiving me,

910
00:53:34,895 --> 00:53:37,231
you said you were willing
to do anything to help me.

911
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,024
Were those empty words?

912
00:53:39,108 --> 00:53:42,069
-What? No, I meant that.
-Then do this for me.

913
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,571
This is the only thing
that you could help me with

914
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:45,906
that's within your power.

915
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,574
I mean…

916
00:53:53,019 --> 00:53:54,729
<i>Make sure to eat well.</i>

917
00:53:54,812 --> 00:53:56,314
Are you back, sweetie?

918
00:53:56,397 --> 00:53:57,690
Hi.

919
00:53:59,776 --> 00:54:01,611
<i>-Welcome--</i>
-This is crazy.

920
00:54:01,694 --> 00:54:03,279
<i>Shin Geum-hui!</i>

921
00:54:03,363 --> 00:54:04,656
Refreshing beer for the table!

922
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:06,950
<i>How dare you try to take
my daughter's lover?</i>

923
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:10,537
<i>I'm sorry. I have nothing to say--</i>

924
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,121
<i>Then don't speak!</i>

925
00:54:12,205 --> 00:54:13,748
<i>Shut your mouth!</i>

926
00:54:16,834 --> 00:54:19,045
<i>You have no shame.</i>

927
00:54:19,128 --> 00:54:23,174
Oh, my. Last week Gwang-bok was
getting slapped with a pork cutlet,

928
00:54:23,258 --> 00:54:26,261
and this week, Geum-hui's getting
slapped with a chicken leg?

929
00:54:28,263 --> 00:54:30,974
How could she do that to such a nice girl?

930
00:54:31,683 --> 00:54:34,769
You think a rich family would
ever accept a girl like Geum-hui?

931
00:54:34,852 --> 00:54:37,522
Her family just runs
a local fried chicken shop.

932
00:54:38,481 --> 00:54:39,774
Oh, my gosh.

933
00:54:39,857 --> 00:54:41,276
What's wrong with that?

934
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,861
I didn't mean Ha-ri.
We're talking about the TV show.

935
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:46,948
All those rubbish TV shows need to go
off the air, you hear?

936
00:54:47,031 --> 00:54:50,618
The love story where a poor girl
falls in love with a superrich guy?

937
00:54:50,702 --> 00:54:52,120
It's not realistic at all.

938
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:56,708
<i>Mom. That unrealistic love story</i>

939
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:58,626
<i>is happening to me right now.</i>

940
00:54:59,168 --> 00:55:02,755
What? Is it that bastard Tae-moo again?

941
00:55:11,931 --> 00:55:13,433
Hi, Min-woo.

942
00:55:13,516 --> 00:55:16,394
Hey, I'm going to forget your face.
Why haven't you stopped by?

943
00:55:17,103 --> 00:55:19,272
I've been a bit busy at work.

944
00:55:19,939 --> 00:55:22,734
What's wrong with your voice?
Did something happen?

945
00:55:22,817 --> 00:55:24,861
Work has been stressing me out a bit.

946
00:55:25,987 --> 00:55:26,946
Yeah.

947
00:55:28,156 --> 00:55:30,450
Okay, I'll swing by soon.

948
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:32,076
All right.

949
00:55:32,577 --> 00:55:33,494
Okay.

950
00:55:37,081 --> 00:55:38,916
Kang Tae-moo, that bastard.

951
00:55:39,584 --> 00:55:43,004
I'm so stressed about that archaeopteryx.
I can't focus on anything.

952
00:55:43,087 --> 00:55:44,839
<i>Hey! I could have gotten hurt!</i>

953
00:55:44,922 --> 00:55:46,257
Jeez.

954
00:55:46,341 --> 00:55:48,301
Rich people are people too.

955
00:55:48,384 --> 00:55:52,055
Why do they only ever scream and yell?
They're always portrayed as the bad guys.

956
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:53,556
I'm back.

957
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,933
Hey! Did you…

958
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,395
set a date for us
to meet with your girlfriend?

959
00:55:59,479 --> 00:56:00,521
Pardon?

960
00:56:00,605 --> 00:56:04,942
Why are you making that face?
Is something wrong?

961
00:56:06,986 --> 00:56:09,572
No, don't worry. You'll see her then.

962
00:56:10,448 --> 00:56:11,366
Really?

963
00:56:18,998 --> 00:56:21,417
What is it now?

964
00:56:26,047 --> 00:56:27,298
Hello?

965
00:56:27,382 --> 00:56:28,883
<i>Where are you?</i>

966
00:56:28,966 --> 00:56:31,552
Where would I be at this hour?
I'm at home, of course.

967
00:56:31,636 --> 00:56:34,180
Then come down for a second.
I'm in front of your house.

968
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:37,558
You're in front of my house? Now?

969
00:56:37,642 --> 00:56:39,018
Wait, hold on. Why?

970
00:56:44,774 --> 00:56:46,985
Why would you drop by this late
without telling me?

971
00:56:47,068 --> 00:56:48,945
I was about to go to bed.

972
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:51,656
It looks like your lights are still on.

973
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:52,740
Oh, right.

974
00:56:52,824 --> 00:56:55,952
-Would you rather I let myself in?
-No! I'll come out!

975
00:56:56,035 --> 00:56:59,330
You just stay put, okay?

976
00:57:00,498 --> 00:57:03,876
This guy is just so stubborn!

977
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,587
Wait, what do I have to--

978
00:57:08,631 --> 00:57:09,716
First, let's…

979
00:57:19,142 --> 00:57:20,810
Can you even see anything?

980
00:57:24,605 --> 00:57:26,357
I thought you were about to go to bed.

981
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:28,985
I never let anybody see
what I look like without makeup.

982
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:30,695
It's like a rule as a woman.

983
00:57:32,155 --> 00:57:35,450
Judging by what you're wearing,
that "rule" doesn't seem to be consistent.

984
00:57:36,284 --> 00:57:38,536
Whatever.
Why did you come all the way here?

985
00:57:41,748 --> 00:57:43,666
I drafted up a contract. Take a look.

986
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:46,377
And memorize my profile
before you meet my grandfather.

987
00:57:46,461 --> 00:57:49,714
I said I would think about it,
not that I would do it.

988
00:57:49,797 --> 00:57:52,925
I don't think
I have any other options but you.

989
00:57:53,509 --> 00:57:55,053
You said you would repay me.

990
00:57:55,136 --> 00:57:57,889
-So let's do it. A contract relationship.
-No.

991
00:57:58,389 --> 00:57:59,766
Just find some other woman.

992
00:58:02,769 --> 00:58:04,020
Damn it.

993
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,356
Ms. Shin Geum-hui.

994
00:58:13,654 --> 00:58:15,198
Are you really going
to back out like this?

995
00:58:15,281 --> 00:58:17,450
No, that's not what I'm saying.

996
00:58:17,533 --> 00:58:20,536
It's because I really have
a reason I can't do it.

997
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,038
<i>How am I supposed to fool</i>

998
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:24,999
<i>both the president and chairman
of the company that I work at?</i>

999
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:26,918
What's your reason? Let's hear it.

1000
00:58:27,001 --> 00:58:28,544
So it's--

1001
00:58:33,257 --> 00:58:34,967
-Wait, first--
-What are you doing?

1002
00:58:35,885 --> 00:58:37,178
Let's talk tomorrow!

1003
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:40,479
