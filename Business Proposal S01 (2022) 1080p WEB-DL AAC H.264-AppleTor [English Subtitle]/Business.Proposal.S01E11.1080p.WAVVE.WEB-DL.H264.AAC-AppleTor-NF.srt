BUSINESS PROPOSAL

2
00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:09,049
I didn't mean to lie to you
from the very beginning.

3
00:00:09,132 --> 00:00:12,594
I just happened to go on
that blind date, and I met Mr. Kang--

4
00:00:12,677 --> 00:00:13,970
Blind date?

5
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:16,723
Why were you there?

6
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:19,351
I'm friends
with Jin Young-seo of Marine Group.

7
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:21,728
She didn't want
to go on the blind date, so…

8
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:22,896
And?

9
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:25,899
After Mr. Kang found out
that I was a fake,

10
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:29,319
he asked me
to pretend to be his girlfriend.

11
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:34,032
because he didn't want to
waste his time on blind dates.

12
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:37,953
So, you weren't a real couple
in the first place,

13
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:41,122
but started seeing each other
just to trick me?

14
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:48,546
-Yes, sir. But--
-If there's nothing between you two,

15
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:51,508
-then I don't need to hear more of this.
-But…

16
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:55,136
Stop seeing Tae-moo.

17
00:00:56,137 --> 00:00:58,473
I don't think
you want to be in a situation

18
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:00,850
that other people may misinterpret.

19
00:01:02,394 --> 00:01:04,020
Sir, I have something to tell you…

20
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:05,647
Yes, Sung-hoon.

21
00:01:07,148 --> 00:01:08,024
What?

22
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:09,943
What about Tae-moo?

23
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:18,785
I'm fine!

24
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:22,622
Yes, let's go.

25
00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:47,105
Mom!

26
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:48,398
Come on, Tae-moo!

27
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:49,482
Dad!

28
00:02:01,244 --> 00:02:02,871
How dare you show up here?

29
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:03,872
Sir.

30
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:05,915
Didn't you hear me?

31
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:09,878
I don't want anybody to see
anything that could be misinterpreted.

32
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:14,883
Grandfather…

33
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:17,969
I don't want you calling me that.

34
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,807
Whose fault do you think it is
that Tae-moo got into an accident?

35
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:26,519
I'm fine, so don't get upset.

36
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:31,858
Are you all right, Tae-moo?

37
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:35,445
Are you hurt anywhere else?

38
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:42,702
You got into a fake relationship because
you didn't want to go on blind dates?

39
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:47,123
How could you
tell an absurd lie like that?

40
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:53,213
I'll be on my way now, President Kang.

41
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:07,560
Grandfather.

42
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:11,439
We're not in a fake relationship.

43
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:29,499
I love Shin Ha-ri.

44
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,932
EPISODE 11

45
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:48,726
Did you

46
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:51,312
know all about this, too?

47
00:03:52,897 --> 00:03:53,940
I'm sorry, sir.

48
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:57,485
So you two worked together to fool me?

49
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:00,155
You bastards!

50
00:04:02,282 --> 00:04:04,242
Don't be mad at Sung-hoon.

51
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:06,703
He's my secretary.
Of course he's on my side.

52
00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:09,122
What are you thinking?

53
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:12,208
You need to end this now!

54
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:14,460
Fine.

55
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:15,420
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
<i>A BUSINESS PROPOSAL</i>

56
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:16,337
But…

57
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:18,756
don't expect to ever have
any great-grandkids.

58
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:21,301
What?

59
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:24,262
-What do you--
-I don't think that I'll ever meet

60
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:26,014
a woman I love as much as Ha-ri.

61
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:27,682
So do as you please

62
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:31,769
if you want me to devote myself only
to work and never get married.

63
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:34,063
Are you threatening me right now?

64
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,109
Grandfather, that's not what I--

65
00:04:38,193 --> 00:04:40,403
What if I say, "Over my dead body"?

66
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:43,156
You liked her
when you met her as Geum-hui.

67
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:44,449
Back then,

68
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:48,912
I didn't know that it was all a lie.

69
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:52,707
Everything about her has been a lie.

70
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,584
I'm the one who made her do that.

71
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:57,378
I forced her
into a contractual relationship.

72
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:00,632
All of this is mostly my fault.

73
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:04,636
So direct your hate at me,

74
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:07,263
and cut her some slack.

75
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:12,060
I genuinely like her,

76
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:13,937
Grandfather.

77
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:18,733
I'm so glad that Tae-moo
didn't get seriously injured.

78
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:21,069
Chairman Kang
must have been really surprised.

79
00:05:21,152 --> 00:05:22,278
Yes.

80
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,698
By the way, what did he say to you?

81
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:28,117
Did he give you money
and tell you to break up?

82
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:29,911
Are you trying to cheer me up?

83
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:32,246
No, it's not that.

84
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,959
Don't you remember my ex from college?
The guy from that indie band.

85
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:40,088
My dad gave him an envelope of money
because I was so obsessed with him.

86
00:05:41,798 --> 00:05:45,009
And he disappeared with that envelope.

87
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:50,098
What is this?

88
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,685
Why does it rain so often these days?

89
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:57,146
Young-seo, I'm sorry,
but I need to go back to the hospital.

90
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,357
What? Why? It's raining!

91
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,526
I'm sorry. Could you pull over?

92
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:15,832
You should go back now, sir.

93
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,543
Okay.

94
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:27,427
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:30,430
It's raining outside,

96
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:32,765
so I was worried

97
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:35,184
about Tae-moo.

98
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:52,869
You can go in.

99
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:12,472
Don't turn on the lights.

100
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:20,229
What are you doing over there?

101
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,482
I was looking out the window.

102
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:26,194
Why did you come back?

103
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:31,991
Don't tell me…

104
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:37,538
Because you missed me?

105
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:41,959
Yes, you're right.

106
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:44,295
Come here.

107
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:55,056
Do you see that?

108
00:07:57,517 --> 00:08:00,269
What about the N Seoul Tower?

109
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:05,400
I just remembered,
my father told me once that the tower

110
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:07,819
looked like a Christmas tree.

111
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:09,612
What do you think?

112
00:08:10,113 --> 00:08:12,365
Now that you say that,
I can kind of see it.

113
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,660
On that day,

114
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,621
my father was put
in a really awkward situation.

115
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:22,417
I caught him wrapping
some Christmas presents for me.

116
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:26,045
I cried asking
if Santa Claus didn't exist,

117
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:29,006
and my mother had a hard time
calming me down.

118
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,676
Your parents must have
been really flustered.

119
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,635
Yes.

120
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:35,179
But my mother told me

121
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:40,351
that Santa Claus was busy,
so he asked him to wrap my presents.

122
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:42,311
She came up with a good cover.

123
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:45,982
So I kept believing in Santa Claus
for a few years after that.

124
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:59,412
I don't remember the last time

125
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:02,707
I looked at the rain for this long.

126
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:09,881
Thank you for coming back
because you were worried about me.

127
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:15,344
I used to hate it.

128
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:21,225
Words of sympathy or worried expressions.

129
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:25,354
I felt like no one knew
what I was really feeling.

130
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:29,317
So they just felt like
empty words and actions.

131
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:33,946
So I pretended to be fine,
and eventually, I believed it too.

132
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:37,033
But one day…

133
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:41,871
I realized I was rotting on the inside.

134
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:45,958
So I was in a lot of pain for a while.

135
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:48,169
I think

136
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:50,963
that anybody would have felt the same.

137
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,053
My parents' accident…

138
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,889
happened because of me.

139
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,401
Don't go, Mom.

140
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:14,111
It's my birthday today.

141
00:10:15,696 --> 00:10:20,368
Dad, you said you would go
to an amusement park with me today.

142
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:22,662
Tae-moo.

143
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:26,707
We'll be right back, okay?

144
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,300
We're on our way back so we can go
to the amusement park with you, Tae-moo.

145
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:37,718
Wait just a bit longer.

146
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:40,388
Hurry back. We're already late.

147
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:41,847
Quickly!

148
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:45,017
Tae-moo, you shouldn't
talk to your mother like that.

149
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:46,769
Yes, okay.

150
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:48,312
Is Mom coming?

151
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:51,357
Yes, she is. She'll come soon. Okay?

152
00:10:56,737 --> 00:10:57,989
Let's hurry.

153
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:18,301
Dad!

154
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:19,677
Tae-moo, don't look!

155
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,889
-Mom!
-Don't look.

156
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:25,516
Mom!

157
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,226
Tae-moo, come on!

158
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,062
Mom!

159
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:31,314
Tae-moo!

160
00:11:31,397 --> 00:11:32,481
Dad!

161
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:34,233
Don't cry, Tae-moo!

162
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:35,192
<i>Mom!</i>

163
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:36,569
I can never see

164
00:11:38,154 --> 00:11:40,114
my parents' faces in my dreams.

165
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:43,326
Always only the backs of their heads.

166
00:11:44,827 --> 00:11:48,205
And every time,

167
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,086
I think maybe they resent me.

168
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:56,797
And that's why…

169
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:02,261
they won't let me see their faces

170
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:04,889
even in my dreams.

171
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:12,897
How could you

172
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:15,858
say something so ridiculous?

173
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:18,444
Tae-moo.

174
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:24,033
Do you know how bright
your smile was when you were

175
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:27,203
talking about your parents just now?

176
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:31,749
I could tell by looking at that face…

177
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:37,254
how much your parents loved you
when you were growing up.

178
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,759
They loved you so much.
Do you really think…

179
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:45,846
they resent you?

180
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:49,600
Darn it.

181
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:52,728
I'm scared now that I've heard your story.

182
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:56,440
Do you secretly think your accident was
because of me and resent me for it?

183
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:58,150
Not at all.

184
00:12:58,234 --> 00:12:59,985
How could you think that?

185
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:03,322
Look at this.

186
00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:06,367
This is what you're doing.

187
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:10,454
How could your parents resent…

188
00:13:12,998 --> 00:13:15,459
their own son?

189
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:19,213
They probably want you

190
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:22,091
to be happy, more than anybody else.

191
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:28,222
I…

192
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:31,767
thought I didn't deserve to be.

193
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:36,188
I thought that I should never…

194
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:39,608
forgive myself.

195
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:52,830
I'm sure…

196
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,460
your parents want you to be happy.

197
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,380
They probably want you

198
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:06,302
to be free from your past…

199
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:12,099
and live as happily as anybody else.

200
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:45,257
What's wrong with me?

201
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:02,900
Did I really fall asleep here?

202
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,216
Sleep well.

203
00:15:49,154 --> 00:15:50,114
You!

204
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:59,123
Are you going to work this early?

205
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,376
Yes.

206
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,420
There's a lot to do at work today.

207
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:08,549
Look at you, working so hard
to earn money.

208
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:10,885
You've got this! Have a great day!

209
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:11,844
Okay.

210
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:13,262
And always be careful.

211
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:15,264
-Yes, but I--
-Come on.

212
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:18,434
Don't skip any meals,
and don't buy any weird foods, okay?

213
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:20,436
-Okay.
-I'm so proud of you.

214
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,395
Go on.

215
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:23,355
-Bye, I'll see you later.
-Okay.

216
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:32,114
Where's my phone?

217
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:34,617
Did I leave it at the hospital?

218
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:37,453
Ha-ri.

219
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:40,247
What are you doing here?

220
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:41,624
Here, Ha-ri.

221
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:43,459
Hey!

222
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:47,087
I left this in here, then?
I thought I'd lost it!

223
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:48,964
Thank you, my friend!

224
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:52,176
Look at the comments
on the nertube video of you and Min-woo.

225
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:54,219
Why?

226
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,388
It's complicated. Just look at it.

227
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:58,599
Yoo-ra made a mess of things again.

228
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:02,686
<i>Chef Lee Min-woo and the researcher
look so good together.</i>

229
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,272
<i>That's true. Maybe they're already dating.</i>

230
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:07,524
Your phone was blowing up
early in the morning,

231
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:09,735
so I looked to see if something was wrong.

232
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,238
<i>They look good together, right?</i>

233
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:15,407
<i>Even as his girlfriend,</i>

234
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:17,826
<i>I think that they look cute together, too.</i>

235
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,911
<i>Maybe too much.</i>

236
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,040
<i>She's had a crush on Min-woo
for seven years</i>

237
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:24,875
<i>and followed him around as a friend.</i>

238
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,045
<i>And now she's hitting on him
using work as an excuse.</i>

239
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:31,715
<i>What's funnier is that her boyfriend
is the president of her company.</i>

240
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,009
<i>She always pretends
to be so pitiful, kind,</i>

241
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:37,888
<i>and acts like she's the victim</i>

242
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:41,016
<i>while going back and forth
between the two men.</i>

243
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,477
<i>It makes me sick.</i>

244
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,276
<i>If that's true, isn't
the go food researcher a total snake?</i>

245
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,780
<i>Breaking news! Her boyfriend
is the president of go food!</i>

246
00:17:56,907 --> 00:18:02,079
<i>Oh, my God. So she's two-timing
the president and the chef?</i>

247
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:03,122
My goodness…

248
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:05,874
<i>So she's dating her boss
to get her crush work?</i>

249
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,043
<i>This is like the plot
of a really bad TV show.</i>

250
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:10,295
<i>That researcher's really something.</i>

251
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:15,092
Do you think it's true,
what they're saying in the comments?

252
00:18:16,218 --> 00:18:17,970
Yes, that's why she posted it.

253
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:19,680
The picture says it all.

254
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:22,891
How could he date his employee
at a time like this?

255
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:25,894
What's the point of taking down
the nertube video

256
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,230
and blocking the comments

257
00:18:28,313 --> 00:18:31,650
when there are people like you
babbling away on the inside?

258
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:33,610
Sir, it's not like that.

259
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:35,821
We were just worried.

260
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:37,114
If you're worried,

261
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,201
then watch your own mouth!

262
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:56,216
The higher-ups wanted to see you, right?
What did they say?

263
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,968
Will Ms. Shin be disciplined?

264
00:18:58,052 --> 00:19:00,763
Ms. Kim, did you
put the paper on the door like I said?

265
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:02,181
I did.

266
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:03,515
NO ENTRY
EXCEPT FOR TEAM 1

267
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,061
Come on, we're all a part
of the Food Development team.

268
00:19:07,144 --> 00:19:08,812
We're just like family, right?

269
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:12,399
Did you guys know
that those two were dating?

270
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:13,609
If we knew,

271
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:17,112
would we be sitting here
looking shell-shocked like this?

272
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:19,656
How did Ms. Shin
seduce President Kang, anyway?

273
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:22,493
Do you think President Kang
knows she two-timed him?

274
00:19:22,576 --> 00:19:25,245
Why do you think
he didn't come to work today?

275
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:28,457
The shock and the embarrassment
of being two-timed.

276
00:19:29,374 --> 00:19:31,627
I wouldn't come to work
if I were him, either.

277
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,462
I could never.

278
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:35,631
I'm sorry that I'm late.

279
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:41,136
Look at the time! How could you be
so late? You didn't even pick up my calls!

280
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,306
I'm sorry. I lost my phone.

281
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:46,475
-Have a good day, then.
-Bye.

282
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:49,853
You know the current situation, right?

283
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:51,980
Yes.

284
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:55,192
-But, Ms. Yeo--
-Hold it for a second. Just listen.

285
00:19:56,693 --> 00:20:00,364
The higher-ups want us
to stop what we're doing.

286
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:02,533
What?

287
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:04,409
-What?
-They took down the nertube video

288
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:06,203
and blocked all of the comments,

289
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:08,914
but the story has spread already.
It's not looking good.

290
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,837
I think they've decided
it's a bad idea to continue with a project

291
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,173
that has your name on it.

292
00:20:18,257 --> 00:20:20,050
Then what will happen to our project?

293
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:22,094
They'll hand it over to Team 2 and 3.

294
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:24,513
Then what do they want us to do now?

295
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:25,931
Come to work to do nothing?

296
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:28,684
They want us to assist Team 2 and 3.

297
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:30,853
We did all the hard work,

298
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:33,397
but the other teams will take the credit.

299
00:20:34,773 --> 00:20:37,025
I was hoping
that I would get promoted this time.

300
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:38,610
I guess not…

301
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:48,996
Chairman Kang was worried
Tae-moo would lose it,

302
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,706
so he told them not to tell him.

303
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,124
Really?

304
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:54,585
How about you? Are you okay?

305
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,629
Are your coworkers
talking behind your back?

306
00:20:57,713 --> 00:20:59,798
No. Not at all.

307
00:20:59,882 --> 00:21:03,218
I was just about to go out
for lunch with my coworkers.

308
00:21:03,302 --> 00:21:05,012
I'll hang up now.

309
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:06,889
Okay, then.

310
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:09,892
Yes. I'll call you later.

311
00:21:13,562 --> 00:21:17,357
I love you too. I love you.

312
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,735
You're having a really good time.

313
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:22,487
What? Why are you glaring at me like that?

314
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:27,159
-Do you have something to say to me?
-You have to be very careful.

315
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,660
Don't you know your father?

316
00:21:29,328 --> 00:21:31,288
Why are you raining on my parade?

317
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,373
Why would you bring up Dad?

318
00:21:33,457 --> 00:21:37,252
Don't make it so obvious at work
that you're in a relationship.

319
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:40,005
He'll be angry if he finds out
that you're dating Sung-hoon.

320
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:41,548
Mind your own business.

321
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:44,176
Don't you dare tell him.
I'll kill you if you do.

322
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:45,969
Don't worry!

323
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:48,889
It's not for you.

324
00:21:49,765 --> 00:21:52,434
-What?
-It's not because of you!

325
00:21:53,352 --> 00:21:55,187
I won't tell him

326
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:57,105
for Sung-hoon's sake.

327
00:21:58,357 --> 00:21:59,858
This is the last act…

328
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:04,529
of kindness I can do for him.

329
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:07,574
Do you understand what I say?

330
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,034
Right.

331
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:11,745
What is this?

332
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:14,623
I guess she really liked Sung-hoon.

333
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:22,464
Too bad our tastes in men overlap.

334
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,218
Maybe I shouldn't have come to work.

335
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,344
Yes.

336
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:29,972
-Let's sit for a bit.
-Yes, ma'am.

337
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:30,889
Sure.

338
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:37,980
I wonder where Ms. Shin is.
I didn't see her in the cafeteria.

339
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:42,943
Stop worrying about Ms. Shin.
Let's worry about ourselves.

340
00:22:43,944 --> 00:22:46,613
Our work lives are about
to get harder because of someone.

341
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:50,784
Did you hear?

342
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:54,413
The employee in Food Product Development
Team 1 who's dating President Kang…

343
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:57,457
I hear she got her Mega Hit Award
because she was dating Mr. Kang.

344
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,626
-Really?
-Yes.

345
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,004
I saw her picture,
and she's not even that pretty.

346
00:23:02,838 --> 00:23:05,966
I wonder how she seduced President Kang.

347
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,926
Right?

348
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,679
Apparently, she's had a lot of flings
with other guys too.

349
00:23:11,805 --> 00:23:14,474
-Shouldn't we tell President Kang?
-You will?

350
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:21,189
-Looks like you're having fun.
-Sir?

351
00:23:21,273 --> 00:23:24,109
You're having so much fun
talking about something

352
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:25,736
-that hasn't even been confirmed yet.
-Who are you?

353
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:27,779
Me? I'm on Team 1.

354
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:31,158
Just like the employee
that you were talking about.

355
00:23:32,242 --> 00:23:33,493
Associate Director Gye Bin.

356
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:36,329
Hello, sir.

357
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:40,375
She didn't get her award
because she was dating President Kang.

358
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:41,960
She's always been competent.

359
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:44,337
-Right?
-Yes.

360
00:23:44,421 --> 00:23:46,590
Ms. Shin has always been good at her job.

361
00:23:46,673 --> 00:23:47,841
Of course!

362
00:23:47,924 --> 00:23:51,261
She got that award over her senior.

363
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:55,140
I'm that senior she surpassed.

364
00:23:55,223 --> 00:23:56,433
-Yes, sir.
-She beat me.

365
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:58,935
-That says it all.
-Of course. Yes.

366
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:02,314
Let's not talk so badly about something
that you don't know about.

367
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:03,231
Okay?

368
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:07,194
Also, our Ms. Shin is

369
00:24:07,694 --> 00:24:11,490
way prettier than you.

370
00:24:12,574 --> 00:24:13,658
What?

371
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:16,661
See? That's…

372
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:18,705
Let's go. Yes.

373
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:21,458
Goodbye, sir. Wait for me.

374
00:24:26,254 --> 00:24:29,633
Mr. Gye, that made me feel great.
I didn't think you had it in you.

375
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:30,634
It's nothing.

376
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:33,887
Yes. You've been the one grumbling
about this the most,

377
00:24:34,721 --> 00:24:37,182
but I guess
she's your teammate, after all.

378
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:40,477
Of course,
I should take my teammate's side.

379
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:43,605
It's okay if I talk badly
about my own family,

380
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:46,066
but I can't stand it
when other people do it.

381
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,983
Look at you.

382
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:49,611
What?

383
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:51,696
Ms. Shin!

384
00:24:54,074 --> 00:24:55,408
How long have you been there?

385
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:01,832
Mr. Gye!

386
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:04,292
Oh, my God.

387
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:15,303
-Wait, Ms. Shin, wait.
-Wait. Can you let go--

388
00:25:15,387 --> 00:25:16,888
I'm sorry.

389
00:25:17,764 --> 00:25:19,891
I thought you guys hated me now.

390
00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:25,063
I love you.

391
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:30,652
What brings you here?
Are you meeting Ha-ri?

392
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:33,321
Yes. Has anything happened here?

393
00:25:33,405 --> 00:25:36,408
What? Mom, nothing bad
happened here, right?

394
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:37,325
No, why?

395
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:39,327
Young-seo asked. I'm going on a delivery.

396
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:41,121
-Go, quick.
-I'm going.

397
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:44,166
Look at him. I was just asking
about the store, that's all.

398
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:47,502
-Ms. Han.
-Yes.

399
00:25:47,586 --> 00:25:49,504
Draft beer
and two orders of fried chicken.

400
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:50,881
One each for Ha-ri and me.

401
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:51,882
-One each?
-Yes.

402
00:25:51,965 --> 00:25:53,216
Sure.

403
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,759
I'll get the beer.

404
00:25:54,843 --> 00:25:55,719
Sure.

405
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:01,391
I don't think she knows yet,
thank goodness.

406
00:26:01,975 --> 00:26:05,228
Gosh, the president of go food
is dating his employee.

407
00:26:05,312 --> 00:26:08,690
But someone exposed
that she's two-timed him,

408
00:26:08,773 --> 00:26:10,775
and it's a mess right now.

409
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,113
Wait, the owners' daughter
works at go food.

410
00:26:15,197 --> 00:26:16,781
-Yes.
-Right.

411
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:22,996
Hey, you're spilling our precious beer.
Snap out of it.

412
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,664
-I'm sorry.
-Come on, Young-seo.

413
00:26:24,748 --> 00:26:26,291
Should we ask the owners?

414
00:26:26,374 --> 00:26:27,459
Sir.

415
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,586
-What?
-You said that

416
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:31,671
your daughter works at go food, right?

417
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:33,423
Yes, why?

418
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:38,345
What? Why did you scream? What is it?

419
00:26:39,304 --> 00:26:40,972
-I--
-Here.

420
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:42,682
-Here--
-I will…

421
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:50,482
pay for everyone's drinks

422
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:52,817
-and food!
-Really?

423
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:53,944
Give me the menu, here.

424
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:56,238
-Oh, sure.
-I want two beers.

425
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:59,574
-Sir, could I have some beer?
-We have so many customers.

426
00:26:59,658 --> 00:27:01,701
-Slowly.
-Right, gently.

427
00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:03,912
Does it hurt?

428
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:05,997
A bit more gently, then.

429
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:12,545
-It's not.
-It's not.

430
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:14,381
I'll come back later.

431
00:27:15,882 --> 00:27:16,967
Wait.

432
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:19,719
This is your fault!

433
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:20,845
I hate this, too.

434
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:21,805
What?

435
00:27:25,684 --> 00:27:26,893
Slowly.

436
00:27:28,061 --> 00:27:29,521
Let's do this side first.

437
00:27:30,188 --> 00:27:32,023
I also hate you

438
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:34,025
breathing down on my neck.

439
00:27:35,443 --> 00:27:36,611
Why did you whisper?

440
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:38,488
It's better than yelling.

441
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:42,033
-I was trying to be nice.
-Don't try to be nice, please.

442
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:45,078
Here!

443
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:49,040
It smells good. What cologne do you use?

444
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:50,583
Come on!

445
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:54,004
You can button those up by yourself.

446
00:27:59,384 --> 00:28:01,720
You got everything that I wanted, right?

447
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:04,139
Why did you make me do that?

448
00:28:09,394 --> 00:28:12,063
Why do you need so many books
all of a sudden?

449
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:13,189
I'm bored.

450
00:28:13,857 --> 00:28:15,984
The chairman's not letting me do any work.

451
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:25,827
I thought you'd need it.

452
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,333
What are you going to do

453
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:33,710
regarding Ha-ri?

454
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:37,464
Chairman Kang is firmly against it.

455
00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:39,841
You can't just keep pushing this on him.

456
00:28:39,924 --> 00:28:44,095
Would you be able to give up Young-seo
if her father didn't approve of you two?

457
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:49,309
Although I feel bad for my grandfather,

458
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:51,478
I'm not giving up Ha-ri.

459
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:05,450
I never thought that I would
end up spending 457,000 won on chicken.

460
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:08,787
Maybe I should frame this.

461
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:14,125
So why did you pay for everyone there?

462
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:17,128
Why do you think? I didn't want
everyone to find out about you!

463
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:20,298
Thanks for that.

464
00:29:21,883 --> 00:29:24,219
I'm already on a tight budget.

465
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:27,013
I'm really going to be broke this month.

466
00:29:29,182 --> 00:29:31,017
My neck.

467
00:29:31,518 --> 00:29:32,394
Are you hurt?

468
00:29:32,477 --> 00:29:34,521
Young-seo, you must be hurt?

469
00:29:34,604 --> 00:29:35,605
Where, here?

470
00:29:35,689 --> 00:29:38,942
-Does it hurt right here?
-I'm a bit sore right here.

471
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:41,027
Hey, Shin Ha-ri.

472
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:44,364
Be thankful that you have
a friend like me.

473
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:47,575
Of course.

474
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,745
Hey, that's why I treat you so well.

475
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:52,288
Right.

476
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:55,500
This is all because of Yoo-ra.

477
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,002
Why are those two so quiet
after making this mess?

478
00:29:58,086 --> 00:29:59,421
Did Min-woo call you?

479
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:02,257
He did, but…

480
00:30:03,508 --> 00:30:04,509
But?

481
00:30:05,468 --> 00:30:06,594
I just

482
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:08,805
didn't pick up.

483
00:30:08,888 --> 00:30:11,641
Why? You should have yelled at him.

484
00:30:11,725 --> 00:30:13,643
I was going to at first,

485
00:30:14,728 --> 00:30:16,062
but I thought about it

486
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,815
and I'm at fault too.

487
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:22,610
One of the comments said
something like this.

488
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:26,156
"If she's had a crush on him
for seven years,

489
00:30:26,906 --> 00:30:28,324
isn't she basically a stalker?"

490
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:31,911
You shouldn't care about a stupid
comment like that. It's not like you.

491
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:34,706
Hey, you said that I was
obsessed with him, too.

492
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:36,833
Hey, that's different.

493
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:40,837
If my best friend thought that too,

494
00:30:42,046 --> 00:30:43,214
then what would have…

495
00:30:44,883 --> 00:30:46,926
Yoo-ra thought of me?

496
00:30:49,262 --> 00:30:50,472
So, I'm just going to say…

497
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:53,391
that we both got even.

498
00:30:55,977 --> 00:30:58,021
How can you say that about this situation?

499
00:30:58,104 --> 00:31:01,399
If it were me,
I would have punched Yoo-ra in the face.

500
00:31:01,483 --> 00:31:03,568
I used to be called Bloody Head, remember?

501
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:05,612
Should I show you my skills again?

502
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:08,364
Young-seo.

503
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:09,949
Ha-ri.

504
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:22,420
What?

505
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:24,839
Hello?

506
00:31:24,923 --> 00:31:27,050
<i>Hello. Is this Ms. Shin Ha-ri?</i>

507
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:27,967
Who is this?

508
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:30,512
<i>I called you to remind you
of something important.</i>

509
00:31:30,595 --> 00:31:32,388
<i>Can you guess what it is?</i>

510
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:38,478
What are you doing, Tae-moo?

511
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:39,729
What do you think?

512
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:42,732
I'm calling the girlfriend
who's been ignoring her injured boyfriend.

513
00:31:43,858 --> 00:31:45,652
I thought you would drop by after work.

514
00:31:45,735 --> 00:31:48,446
I'm sorry. I've been
all over the place today.

515
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,323
Do you know who I'm with right now?

516
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:52,951
What? Who are you with? Who?

517
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:53,952
A friend.

518
00:31:54,494 --> 00:31:56,120
You probably know this friend, too.

519
00:31:56,204 --> 00:31:58,665
Me? A friend who I know?

520
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:02,252
-Who is it?
-I have a friend like that.

521
00:32:02,794 --> 00:32:06,673
A thoughtful friend who listens to me
by my side whenever I'm feeling angry.

522
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,677
Actually, she looked a lot like you,
now that I think about it.

523
00:32:12,595 --> 00:32:15,557
So that friend
must be really pretty, right?

524
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,226
No. She's really ugly.

525
00:32:18,977 --> 00:32:20,770
What? Hey!

526
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,731
I'm just kidding.

527
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:26,150
That friend is

528
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:28,611
the thank-you gift that you gave me

529
00:32:29,153 --> 00:32:30,864
when I went to that concert with you.

530
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:34,033
It's a Worry Doll.

531
00:32:34,534 --> 00:32:38,246
It's a doll that I can talk to
about my worries.

532
00:32:39,205 --> 00:32:40,874
I see.

533
00:32:45,753 --> 00:32:46,754
Why are you sighing?

534
00:32:46,838 --> 00:32:48,089
Is something wrong?

535
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:50,925
No, I just…

536
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:53,845
I just yawned like this.

537
00:32:56,598 --> 00:32:58,683
You're yawning
while talking to your boyfriend?

538
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:00,059
That's a bit harsh.

539
00:33:01,394 --> 00:33:03,313
No, I…

540
00:33:03,396 --> 00:33:05,523
I didn't sleep very well last night.

541
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:06,566
You didn't?

542
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,735
I heard you snoring.

543
00:33:08,818 --> 00:33:10,194
I don't snore.

544
00:33:12,739 --> 00:33:13,907
Did I really snore?

545
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,991
No.

546
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:20,788
Ha-ri.

547
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:22,790
Do you know?

548
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:25,001
Know what?

549
00:33:25,084 --> 00:33:26,669
Honestly, I feel

550
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:29,213
so relieved right now.

551
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:31,841
<i>I've been feeling bad about</i>

552
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:34,344
keeping our relationship a secret…

553
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:37,972
from my grandfather.

554
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:42,268
<i>But now that I don't have to
hide it anymore,</i>

555
00:33:42,852 --> 00:33:44,103
<i>I feel so relieved.</i>

556
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,232
From now on,
I want to tell everyone about it

557
00:33:48,816 --> 00:33:50,652
and meet with you without hiding.

558
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:52,570
So…

559
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:54,822
to do that, Ha-ri…

560
00:33:57,742 --> 00:33:58,868
Yes.

561
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:02,330
We should get…

562
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:04,290
married…

563
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,711
Hello?

564
00:34:09,337 --> 00:34:10,505
The call's disconnecting…

565
00:34:11,255 --> 00:34:12,090
Hello.

566
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:13,633
Hello?

567
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:14,968
Ha-ri?

568
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:16,552
Hello?

569
00:34:17,595 --> 00:34:19,597
I can't hear you. Hello?

570
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:20,807
Ha-ri.

571
00:34:21,766 --> 00:34:22,809
Ha-ri!

572
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:26,813
Wait, are there any coins?

573
00:34:27,981 --> 00:34:28,815
Coins…

574
00:34:29,983 --> 00:34:31,275
Damn it.

575
00:34:38,157 --> 00:34:40,743
Why did it have to cut off
at such an important moment?

576
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:45,206
I think I'm going to send Tae-moo
by next month.

577
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:52,213
So make sure to take care of
the house and car in New York.

578
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:54,549
Yes, okay.

579
00:34:56,676 --> 00:34:58,261
Am I going to the United States?

580
00:34:58,344 --> 00:34:59,595
Where have you been?

581
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,848
Tell me. Am I going?

582
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,726
Sit.

583
00:35:09,397 --> 00:35:11,399
You haven't even talked to me about this.

584
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:17,071
Are you doing this because of Ha-ri?

585
00:35:19,323 --> 00:35:21,200
Are you doing this to pry us apart?

586
00:35:21,868 --> 00:35:23,911
Do you think it'll break us up?

587
00:35:23,995 --> 00:35:25,204
I know.

588
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:28,624
I know that this isn't enough
to separate you two.

589
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:31,127
So why are you doing this?
This isn't like you.

590
00:35:32,545 --> 00:35:36,549
Okay, so let's say

591
00:35:37,216 --> 00:35:39,886
that I approve of you two.

592
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:44,265
But, once people find out
that you're dating,

593
00:35:44,932 --> 00:35:49,812
do you think
that she'll be able to come to work?

594
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:54,025
The employees will gossip about it.

595
00:35:54,609 --> 00:35:55,943
You might be fine,

596
00:35:56,944 --> 00:35:59,655
but she's just an employee.

597
00:36:00,281 --> 00:36:01,824
She won't be able to endure it.

598
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:05,161
Until it blows over,

599
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:08,122
work at the American branch for two years.

600
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,751
If you haven't changed your mind
after that,

601
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:14,087
I'll approve.

602
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:16,089
No.

603
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:19,467
-Tae-moo.
-It won't matter if it's two or 20 years.

604
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:21,427
My feelings will never change.

605
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:23,179
Besides…

606
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:25,681
I don't want to be away from her anymore.

607
00:36:30,436 --> 00:36:31,729
I'm going to marry Ha-ri.

608
00:36:33,898 --> 00:36:37,401
-Tae-moo!
-Then people won't gossip anymore.

609
00:36:40,238 --> 00:36:41,781
So, please

610
00:36:42,698 --> 00:36:45,576
approve of our relationship.

611
00:36:57,964 --> 00:37:00,174
Maybe I should have told Tae-moo.

612
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:07,932
I should have talked to Ha-ri
about marriage, first.

613
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:19,777
Let's have dinner together this weekend.

614
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:20,903
Really?

615
00:37:20,987 --> 00:37:23,656
We've been too busy to have a date lately.

616
00:37:24,282 --> 00:37:26,242
-I'll look forward to it, okay?
-Sure.

617
00:37:27,243 --> 00:37:28,619
Young-seo.

618
00:37:31,747 --> 00:37:34,417
Dad. What are you doing here?

619
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,669
I dropped by to see you,
among other things.

620
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:40,882
Who is this?

621
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,302
Hello, sir. I'm Cha Sung-hoon. I'm--

622
00:37:44,385 --> 00:37:45,928
The man who's dating my daughter?

623
00:37:46,012 --> 00:37:47,597
Have you been watching me?

624
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,600
There are a lot of people
willing to report things to me.

625
00:37:50,683 --> 00:37:52,226
It's nice to meet you, sir.

626
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,187
I think Young-seo has hidden you away

627
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,439
because she didn't want
to introduce you to me.

628
00:37:56,522 --> 00:37:58,191
How about dinner together?

629
00:37:58,274 --> 00:37:59,567
What are you planning?

630
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,319
What do you mean?

631
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:05,448
What's wrong with having dinner
with my daughter's boyfriend?

632
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:09,327
Let's not drag it out. How about tonight?

633
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,919
Right, mix up the filling really well.

634
00:38:18,544 --> 00:38:20,546
I know we're supposed to be helping them,

635
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,590
but they're making us
do all of their work.

636
00:38:22,673 --> 00:38:24,133
Let's look on the bright side.

637
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:26,719
It's more efficient
that we continue to do it.

638
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,973
I want to throw them my letter
of resignation because this is unfair

639
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,435
but I can't since I have to get married.

640
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:36,020
Married?

641
00:38:36,103 --> 00:38:38,564
Mr. Gye, are you marrying Ms. Yeo?

642
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:41,525
What else am I going to do?
The whole company knows about us,

643
00:38:42,151 --> 00:38:43,945
so I need to take responsibility.

644
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:48,115
Stop talking nonsense.

645
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:50,701
Marriage, my foot.

646
00:38:51,953 --> 00:38:53,829
You like it too, Ms. Yeo!

647
00:38:55,915 --> 00:38:56,749
Ms. Shin Ha-ri?

648
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:59,752
Chairman Kang wants to see you.

649
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:03,923
Chairman Kang wants to see me?

650
00:39:15,268 --> 00:39:16,435
I'll be back.

651
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:26,529
Why did he call her?

652
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:28,322
Maybe…

653
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:30,241
Is Ms. Shin getting fired?

654
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:31,826
Don't say useless things.

655
00:39:33,411 --> 00:39:34,704
Let's just see what happens.

656
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,296
Why did you want to see me, sir?

657
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:47,800
I want you to go down to the factory
in Daejeon

658
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:50,928
until this situation dies down.

659
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:52,138
Dae…

660
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:55,224
By Daejeon, you mean…

661
00:39:56,892 --> 00:39:59,145
Isn't that our distribution center?

662
00:39:59,228 --> 00:40:01,939
There's nothing
for a researcher to do there.

663
00:40:02,023 --> 00:40:03,524
If you're unhappy with it

664
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:05,818
then resign.

665
00:40:05,901 --> 00:40:07,236
Re…

666
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:10,072
Resign?

667
00:40:12,074 --> 00:40:13,451
Has anything else been posted?

668
00:40:13,534 --> 00:40:15,119
No.

669
00:40:15,202 --> 00:40:18,622
Rich people are really scary.
They got rid of all the gossip articles.

670
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:19,707
SEOUL KANGSUNG HOSPITAL

671
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,336
Do you think that employee
named Shin Ha-ri is still working there?

672
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:26,005
No way. She must have been fired by now.

673
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:29,342
There are rumors that she's two-timed
the grandson of the chairman.

674
00:40:29,425 --> 00:40:30,718
They must've fired her.

675
00:40:32,428 --> 00:40:34,013
What are you talking about?

676
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:38,434
What was that just now?

677
00:40:40,978 --> 00:40:41,896
Where have you--

678
00:40:41,979 --> 00:40:43,230
Why didn't you tell me?

679
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:44,940
Sir?

680
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:50,780
-That's--
-You should have…

681
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:53,532
You should have told me.

682
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:59,038
Ha-ri must have been suffering
on her own without me.

683
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:02,083
I didn't even know.

684
00:41:03,376 --> 00:41:06,879
Are you going to the office? You should
wait until the chairman's less angry--

685
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,674
Even after all this time,
I should wait more?

686
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:13,177
I can't do that.

687
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:37,118
You need to hear this. Right now--

688
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,161
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 1

689
00:41:39,245 --> 00:41:41,330
Where's Ms. Shin?

690
00:41:41,414 --> 00:41:44,333
Chairman Kang called her up.

691
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:47,795
It's been a while since she was called,
but she hasn't come back.

692
00:41:50,256 --> 00:41:51,549
Damn it.

693
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:01,851
What are you doing here?

694
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:05,521
What did you talk about with Ha-ri?

695
00:42:05,604 --> 00:42:07,857
I told her I'd send her
to a provincial office.

696
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,275
And I told her to resign

697
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:11,777
if she wasn't happy with it.

698
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:12,903
Did you…

699
00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:15,489
Did you have to do this?

700
00:42:15,573 --> 00:42:17,783
You must have heard the rumors, too.

701
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:21,370
You know what she has done
to this company.

702
00:42:21,454 --> 00:42:22,955
How is that her fault?

703
00:42:23,038 --> 00:42:24,415
It's my fault.

704
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:25,958
I liked her first

705
00:42:26,584 --> 00:42:27,835
and caused this situation.

706
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:30,671
I don't think you know
how serious this is.

707
00:42:31,422 --> 00:42:32,590
The board of directors

708
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:36,635
could ask you to take responsibility
for this situation

709
00:42:37,261 --> 00:42:39,638
and ask you to resign.

710
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:42,308
If that's what ends up happening,

711
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,187
then I'll take full responsibility,
and resign.

712
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:48,063
So…

713
00:42:49,356 --> 00:42:50,816
don't do anything to Ha-ri.

714
00:42:55,488 --> 00:42:56,614
Tae-moo!

715
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,000
-Welcome.
-Hello.

716
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:07,421
-He's not here.
-That young owner isn't here today.

717
00:43:07,505 --> 00:43:08,714
-Young owner?
-Yes.

718
00:43:08,798 --> 00:43:10,091
-Please, sit.
-Sure.

719
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:12,510
Are you talking about Ha-ri's father?

720
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:14,553
Honey, come out here for a second.

721
00:43:14,637 --> 00:43:15,679
Why?

722
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:16,931
What is it?

723
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:17,890
-Here.
-What is it?

724
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:19,975
-Oh, my God.
-Not him.

725
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:21,102
There was…

726
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:25,731
There was this tall and handsome guy here.

727
00:43:25,815 --> 00:43:26,690
Yes.

728
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:27,733
With a young woman.

729
00:43:27,817 --> 00:43:30,027
A young woman and a tall guy?

730
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:31,946
Are you talking about Ha-ri and Ha-min?

731
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:34,698
They must be talking about our kids.
They're tall.

732
00:43:34,782 --> 00:43:35,991
I guess so.

733
00:43:36,075 --> 00:43:38,369
There he comes.

734
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:39,995
The handsome young owner!

735
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,790
You must have been mistaken.

736
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:47,128
He's my daughter's coworker.

737
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:48,921
-What?
-His name's Mr. Gye.

738
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:50,756
But I'm sure he's the guy from before.

739
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,924
Hello. Did you--

740
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,426
Yes, Mr. Gye.

741
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:55,636
What brings you
to our restaurant at this hour?

742
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:58,222
Did Ha-ri come back home?

743
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:01,517
What? Ha-ri went to work.

744
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,476
Yes.

745
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,770
Is she not at work?

746
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:08,732
What? Hey!

747
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,947
-Let's talk for a second.
-Sure.

748
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:20,411
Sorry about this.
I'll introduce myself properly next time.

749
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:22,413
Father and Mother.

750
00:44:23,414 --> 00:44:24,623
Okay.

751
00:44:28,586 --> 00:44:33,465
Didn't he just call us Father and Mother?

752
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:34,884
He did.

753
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:45,895
Are you telling me to turn in
my letter of resignation, sir?

754
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:48,189
Yes. Resign,

755
00:44:49,732 --> 00:44:52,359
and leave our company.

756
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:00,993
I can't…

757
00:45:03,162 --> 00:45:04,413
do that, sir.

758
00:45:05,331 --> 00:45:06,165
What?

759
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:07,833
I'm not going to resign.

760
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:11,503
Do you know how hard I've worked
ever since I got hired?

761
00:45:11,587 --> 00:45:13,047
The products I've come up with?

762
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,299
All of them made it
into the top five that year.

763
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:18,510
My Bucket List Fish made it
into the top three.

764
00:45:18,594 --> 00:45:22,431
On top of that, I'm the youngest person
to ever be awarded the Mega Hit award.

765
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:25,142
I don't think it makes any sense
for me to resign.

766
00:45:26,936 --> 00:45:28,312
If love is a crime,

767
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:30,773
then yes, I'm a criminal.

768
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:33,067
But, resign?

769
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:35,736
I can't resign, sir!

770
00:45:39,657 --> 00:45:41,367
I shouldn't have said the last bit.

771
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,493
Ha-ri, you idiot!

772
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:44,995
Why did you have to say that?

773
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:52,419
She's not picking up.

774
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,463
What's wrong?

775
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:56,173
It's hard to explain right now.

776
00:45:57,299 --> 00:46:00,052
Could I borrow your cellphone?
I don't have mine right now.

777
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:06,934
Brother-in-law.

778
00:46:10,229 --> 00:46:12,773
I hope you make up with my sister,
brother-in-law.

779
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:17,611
How is Mr. Gye your brother-in-law?

780
00:46:17,695 --> 00:46:19,905
-Mom.
-Mother.

781
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:23,951
You referred to us as if
we were your in-laws back there, too.

782
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:26,453
Are you and Ha-ri…

783
00:46:26,537 --> 00:46:27,913
Dating? Mr. Gye?

784
00:46:27,997 --> 00:46:29,039
Come on, tell us!

785
00:46:29,123 --> 00:46:33,961
What's your relationship with Ha-ri?
And why did you come to our house?

786
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:37,256
-What? Tell me!
-Mother, that's…

787
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:38,966
Stop calling me like that!

788
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:42,553
You're damn well over 40 years old.
How could you try to date Ha-ri?

789
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:45,055
You think you can do that
since you're handsome?

790
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:46,307
How dare you?

791
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,517
Honey, you can't use violence.

792
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,518
You should go.

793
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,687
-Go where?
-Why?

794
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,397
I'll explain everything later.

795
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,648
Mother and Father.

796
00:46:55,232 --> 00:46:56,275
You're doing again.

797
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:58,110
Where are you going, Mr. Gye?

798
00:46:58,193 --> 00:47:00,404
-Mr. Gye!
-Mom, listen to me.

799
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:03,490
That's not Mr. Gye.
That's go food's president, Mr. Kang

800
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:04,408
What?

801
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:05,909
What are you talking about?

802
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:08,537
How can that person be--

803
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:10,664
I'm being serious!

804
00:47:10,748 --> 00:47:13,292
It's been so hard keeping this a secret.

805
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:16,295
Our hard-working days are over.
You'll get a rich son-in-law!

806
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,465
What? He's rich?

807
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:21,425
President?

808
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:23,719
Rich…

809
00:47:23,802 --> 00:47:25,721
You're so frustrating.

810
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:38,233
HA-MIN'S PHONE
HE DID NOT STEAL IT

811
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:45,532
Where are you, Ha-ri?

812
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:53,457
Sung-hoon.

813
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:57,711
Is this okay? If you don't want
to be here, we can just go.

814
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:00,964
My father could do
a complete 180 and throw a fit.

815
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:02,925
-Let's just--
-It's all right.

816
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:07,805
This is something we need
to go through eventually.

817
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:10,641
Let's go.

818
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:20,859
How long have you two
been seeing each other?

819
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:22,319
A little over a month, sir.

820
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:25,697
I was worried about my daughter,
so I did some research.

821
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:27,324
You don't have any parents,

822
00:48:27,825 --> 00:48:29,743
and you grew up
under Chairman Kang, right?

823
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:32,579
Yes, sir.

824
00:48:32,663 --> 00:48:34,748
If you grew up
with Chairman Kang's support,

825
00:48:34,832 --> 00:48:38,502
does that mean you can't leave go food
and can't work at a different company?

826
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:40,838
-Let's just go, Sung-hoon.
-Young-seo.

827
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:42,965
-Young-seo.
-I've heard enough of this.

828
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:45,634
Why would you ask something like that?

829
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:46,969
What's wrong with it?

830
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:48,762
He might become my son-in-law.

831
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:52,307
Son-in-law?

832
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:53,225
Yes.

833
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:56,353
You're the only child that I have,
so who knows?

834
00:48:56,437 --> 00:49:00,274
What's so wrong with checking
if my son-in-law could inherit my company?

835
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:05,529
Are you saying that you approve of
me dating Sung-soon?

836
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:09,199
If I wasn't going to,
why would I have called him to dinner?

837
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:13,454
I know.

838
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:17,124
I know how stubborn and arrogant
I've been.

839
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:22,254
But I don't want to be on bad terms
with my only daughter anymore.

840
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:28,760
So let's just try to understand each other
a bit more, yeah?

841
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:32,264
Could you come back home, too?

842
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:37,895
Young-seo.

843
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:41,982
Fine.

844
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:44,943
But I need some time
to think about going back home.

845
00:49:54,453 --> 00:49:55,746
What are you thinking about?

846
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,332
It's just my dad.

847
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:01,919
You know what they say,
people do weird things before they die.

848
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:05,339
What if he's sick?

849
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,341
I don't think so.

850
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:10,469
When something good happens,

851
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,931
you should think about it positively.

852
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:15,849
Don't think about something bad.

853
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:18,769
It's just that I've never seen him
like that before.

854
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:24,149
Sorry, Sung-hoon.

855
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,777
Do you have any tissue?

856
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:28,445
You don't.

857
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:30,072
What?

858
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:31,865
What's this?

859
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:36,245
It's nothing. Put it back.

860
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,581
It's for me, isn't it?

861
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:41,875
A ring?

862
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:43,460
A diamond ring?

863
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:47,714
Is this for a proposal?

864
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:52,928
Well, it's your birthday soon.

865
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:54,846
It's your birthday present.

866
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:58,016
What? So you're not going to
propose to me?

867
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:02,104
Well, I will eventually.

868
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:04,565
But I haven't gotten
your father's approval.

869
00:51:04,648 --> 00:51:06,692
And I don't know how you feel about it.

870
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:08,610
We got my father's approval today,

871
00:51:09,194 --> 00:51:10,654
and I want to marry you, too.

872
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:12,239
What?

873
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:14,116
So…

874
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:16,118
let's get married.

875
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:24,668
Sung-hoon.

876
00:51:51,493 --> 00:51:55,164
Do you not want to marry me?

877
00:51:58,041 --> 00:51:59,084
It's not that.

878
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:02,671
You really need to stop stealing my words.

879
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:18,937
Will you marry me?

880
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:23,502
Look at that.
Shin Ha-min left me a voicemail.

881
00:53:24,378 --> 00:53:25,712
My goodness.

882
00:53:25,796 --> 00:53:27,256
<i>Ha-ri, it's me.</i>

883
00:53:27,881 --> 00:53:30,133
<i>Where are you?
Why aren't you picking up my calls?</i>

884
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,470
<i>I've looked everywhere
but I couldn't find you.</i>

885
00:53:34,263 --> 00:53:36,515
<i>Did you hide somewhere
because you're angry at me?</i>

886
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:38,767
<i>Please call me back.</i>

887
00:53:56,868 --> 00:53:58,161
Ha-ri, where are you?

888
00:53:58,745 --> 00:53:59,871
I'm…

889
00:54:01,873 --> 00:54:03,292
in front of the Christmas Tree?

890
00:54:06,086 --> 00:54:07,713
I'm at N Seoul Tower.

891
00:54:08,714 --> 00:54:10,007
What are you doing there?

892
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,425
I don't know.

893
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:16,430
I didn't have anywhere to go,
so I was just walking aimlessly.

894
00:54:19,016 --> 00:54:19,850
Just because?

895
00:54:19,933 --> 00:54:22,185
Don't go anywhere. I'm coming.

896
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,357
Wait--

897
00:55:48,355 --> 00:55:50,148
Do you know how worried I've been?

898
00:56:02,494 --> 00:56:04,371
I'm not a kid.

899
00:56:06,581 --> 00:56:08,125
Never disappear again

900
00:56:09,334 --> 00:56:11,294
without saying anything.

901
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:26,865
